          "details": "Bankless DAO is focused on onboarding 1 Billion people to web3. It does this by building the media rails required for people to learn about the crypto space. By leveraging the power of community, Bankless DAO is solving the problem of coordination, creating wealth for many people, and making it easy for people to understand what web3 is and how to be a part of it. Through developing written and audio media content, building DAO tooling platforms, providing consultancy to other communities, and giving scholarships to people interested in learning web3, Bankless DAO is creating the channels for increasing crypto adoption across the world.\n\nBankless DAO is built on three core values; Education, Culture, and Decentralized Governance. Learning is at the heart of adoption in the web3 space. So, educating one another with accurate information irrespective of the media of communication is integral to what Bankless DAO is building. So far, articles, podcasts, videos, and forum discussions are some of the ways people in the community learn to educate one another on DeFi, DAOs, and web3 in general. Also, Bankless DAO is building a culture of self-organizing systems where the community comes up with new initiatives that drive the growth of the DAO. It is a culture that rewards action-takers and encourages risks. This is because, without risks, there is no reward. Finally, decision-making is not done by a select few but by the collective by implementing decentralized governance where every token holder in the community has a say in the decisions taken in the DAO.\n\nA number of projects have been executed by the community to foster growth and build relationships in the DAO. Some of the projects include:\n\n* [Bankless Consulting](https://www.banklessconsulting.com/): A service that connects over 15,000 web3 talents to professional services in various work areas such as tech, marketing, finance, legal, and management.\n\n* [Degen Project](https://bankless.notion.site/DEGEN-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8): A discord bot that carries out administrative functions across Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Podcast Hatchery](https://bankless.notion.site/Podcast-Hatchery-0c2676175267445180c8f5cb3d3f14bb): A podcast that empowers creators to start their own podcast, improve their production skills, and grow an audio-based audience as they share knowledge on web3 thereby living out the vision of Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Bankless Loans](https://bankless.notion.site/Bankless-Loans-c6b90fad24b24312b184840e49694f7f): This is a DeFi application that provides loans as a way for the DAO to generate revenue for its treasury.\n\n* [Bankless Academy](https://app.banklessacademy.com/): This is an application that teaches people with little or no knowledge of crypto to become competent crypto users.\n\nThere are more projects in Bankless DAO and they all contribute to achieving the mission of onboarding 1 Billion people to the web3 space.\n\nFinally, Bankless DAO has a governance token (BANK) which it uses to vote on decisions made in the DAO. Holders of the token are community members and they collaborate to see that Bankless continues to grow and is positioned to be a massive success.",
