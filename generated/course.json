          "details": "Bankless DAO is focused on onboarding 1 Billion people to web3. It does this by building the media rails required for people to learn about the crypto space. By leveraging the power of community, Bankless DAO is solving the problem of coordination, creating wealth for many people, and making it easy for people to understand what web3 is and how to be a part of it. Through developing written and audio media content, building DAO tooling platforms, providing consultancy to other communities, and giving scholarships to people interested in learning web3, Bankless DAO is creating the channels for increasing crypto adoption across the world.\n\nBankless DAO is built on three core values; Education, Culture, and Decentralized Governance. Learning is at the heart of adoption in the web3 space. So, educating one another with accurate information irrespective of the media of communication is integral to what Bankless DAO is building. So far, articles, podcasts, videos, and forum discussions are some of the ways people in the community learn to educate one another on DeFi, DAOs, and web3 in general. Also, Bankless DAO is building a culture of self-organizing systems where the community comes up with new initiatives that drive the growth of the DAO. It is a culture that rewards action-takers and encourages risks. This is because, without risks, there is no reward. Finally, decision-making is not done by a select few but by the collective by implementing decentralized governance where every token holder in the community has a say in the decisions taken in the DAO.\n\nA number of projects have been executed by the community to foster growth and build relationships in the DAO. Some of the projects include:\n\n* [Bankless Consulting](https://www.banklessconsulting.com/): A service that connects over 15,000 web3 talents to professional services in various work areas such as tech, marketing, finance, legal, and management.\n\n* [Degen Project](https://bankless.notion.site/DEGEN-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8): A discord bot that carries out administrative functions across Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Podcast Hatchery](https://bankless.notion.site/Podcast-Hatchery-0c2676175267445180c8f5cb3d3f14bb): A podcast that empowers creators to start their own podcast, improve their production skills, and grow an audio-based audience as they share knowledge on web3 thereby living out the vision of Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Bankless Loans](https://bankless.notion.site/Bankless-Loans-c6b90fad24b24312b184840e49694f7f): This is a DeFi application that provides loans as a way for the DAO to generate revenue for its treasury.\n\n* [Bankless Academy](https://app.banklessacademy.com/): This is an application that teaches people with little or no knowledge of crypto to become competent crypto users.\n\nThere are more projects in Bankless DAO and they all contribute to achieving the mission of onboarding 1 Billion people to the web3 space.\n\nFinally, Bankless DAO has a governance token (BANK) which it uses to vote on decisions made in the DAO. Holders of the token are community members and they collaborate to see that Bankless continues to grow and is positioned to be a massive success."

          "shortTitle": "Guilds",
          "details": "[Guilds](https://www.bankless.community/about-us/guilds) are the structures for contribution in Bankless DAO. This is how contributors are clustered based on skills, areas of interest, and professional backgrounds to achieve a common goal. In each guild, contributors work with one another to incubate ideas and also perform cross-functional activities to provide support where necessary DAO-wide. There are various guilds in Bankless DAO, namely:\n\n* Analytics Guild\n* Audiovisual Guild\n* DAOlationships Guild\n* Design Guild\n* Developers Guild\n* Education Guild\n* Legal Guild\n* Marketing Guild\n* Operations Guild\n* Research Guild\n* Treasury Guild\n* Translators Guild\n* Writers Guild\n\nThe analytics guild uses data to provide insights and build data-based products for the DAO. The audiovisual guild creates audio and video content for the DAO, and the DAOlationships guild builds partnerships with other organizations and communities. \n\nThe design guild creates designs for the DAO, the developers guild builds tools and provides developer education, and the education guild provides educational materials on web3 and related topics. \n\nThe legal guild handles legal issues and education on legal structures for web3 organizations, the marketing guild uses marketing initiatives to promote the DAO, and the operations guild handles day-to-day administrative tasks. \n\nThe research guild conducts research and documentation, the treasury guild manages the financial resources of the DAO, the translators guild publicizes the DAO's work in different languages, and the writers guild handles writing projects for the DAO. All of these guilds work together to sustainably develop the DAO and achieve its goals.\n",

          "key": "how-are-contributors-compensated",
          "shortTitle": "Compensation",
          "details": "Bankless DAO as other DAOs has contributors working in various guilds to ensure the sustainable growth of the DAO. When these contributors give their time and skills to the DAO, they are rewarded for work done and time spent working on different projects. A common situation for DAOs is thinking about the right way to compensate contributors in a fair manner especially when they are many. For Bankless DAO, the tool used for coordinating compensation is known as [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/).\n\nOn Coordinape, the compensation is done by community members and not the core team. This is so that, other contributors who have seen the impact of their fellow contributors decide who gets compensated. It solves the problem of bias as you only get rewarded if you collaborate with others and they can clearly see that you have done some work. This process of gifting one another tokens based on contributions is done via Gift Circles and what is either given or received is known as GIVE. The GIVE token is the native token used by Coordinape to vote for one another and to be able to either give or receive, a person must be a part of the circle.\n\nThere are three types of contributors that can be rewarded in Bankless DAO using Coordinape; L1 members, L2 members, and guest pass holders. L1 members are those who own at least 35,000 BANK or an equivalent of LP tokens from certified AMMs. L2 members are contributors that have been nominated and voted into leadership roles due to their level of dedication and hardwork in the DAO while guest pass holders are contributors that are active in the DAO but do not have enough BANK tokens. \n\nL1 and L2 members can either give or receive GIVE depending on the circle they are in. However, guest pass holders can only receive. At the end of every epoch (the period it takes for gifting to occur), the GIVE tokens that have been shared by the contributors will be converted into a BANK token which is the native token for Bankless DAO and is sent to all contributors’ wallets. The conversion from GIVE to BANK tokens is dependent on the number of BANK tokens in supply. If there are 1,000 BANK tokens open for supply and a contributor gets  1,000 GIVE tokens out of 10,000 GIVE tokens, then 1,000 GIVE becomes 10% of the total tokens available. 10% multiplied by 1,000 BANK tokens equals 100 BANK tokens.",

          "shortTitle": "Tool: Coordinape",
          "details": "Coordinape being the central compensation platform on Bankless DAO is used to distribute tokens on a monthly basis. The process for distribution is known as a Coordinape round which is a monthly period where GIVE tokens are allocated to contributors. Each round goes through four stages before it is completed.\n\n1. Submission: Every member of the DAO submits a form with relevant information such as their Discord ID,  wallet address, membership type, and other necessary information requested by the DAO.\n2. Upload to Coordinape: Upon submission by active contributors for the month, the admin takes the information submitted and uploads it to their respective Coordinape circles.\n3. Allocation Period: After the upload is completed, contributors will now be able to choose other contributors to gift as a way of compensating them for work done in that month.\n4. Payout: At the end of the round the grants committee will allocate BANK tokens to contributors based on the number of GIVE received in that round.\n\nThere are two rounds through which Bankless DAO uses Coordinape to distribute compensation in form of rounds. These rounds are highlighted below:\n\n* Bankless DAO Coordinape Round\n* Guild/Project Coordinape Round\n\n**Bankless DAO Coordinape Round**\n\nThis is a monthly round that occurs across the DAO to compensate contributors for that month. In this round, contributors are placed in the L1, L2, or Guest Pass Circle.\n\nFor L1 circle, L1 members can both give and receive from other contributors, L2 can only give and guest pass cannot be on this circle. For L2 circle, L1 members can only give, L2 members can both give and receive while guest pass cannot join this circle. Finally, for the guest pass circle, both L1 and L2 members can only give while guest pass members can only receive. \n\n* L1 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L1 can receive\n* L2 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L2 can receive\n* Guest Pass Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only Guest Pass can receive\n\nFor clarity, the table below highlights the different circles and their responsibilities.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td>L1 Circle\n   </td>\n   <td>L2 Circle\n   </td>\n   <td>Guest Pass Circle\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>L1 Members\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give and Receive\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>L2 Members\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give and Receive\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Guest Pass Holders\n   </td>\n   <td>Not Allowed\n   </td>\n   <td>Not Allowed\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Receive Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nWhen organizing the round, the primary coordinator handles the process and there are certain steps that are required.\n\n1. A calendar is set up months ahead with dates for each round. A sample is shown below:\n\n![alt_text](images/image1.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\n2. Set up three Google forms for L1, L2, and guest pass circles. \n3. Ensure Degen is synced with the forms by going to the #degen-general channel on Discord and asking the team to load up the three forms for distribution.\n4. Submit the form links to the Degen team\n5. Test the form in #bot-commands channel on Discord to confirm that the automation is live before the submission period begins.\n6. Announce the submission period on Discord, Community Calls and Weekly Newsletters continuously for at least one week before the date.\n7. Open the links for submissions while still announcing.\n8. Hand over the data 1 - 2 days before submission ends so that the team can give Coordnipae ample time to bulk upload the data from the forms.\n9. Announce allocation period to community members once uploading is completed. \n10. Once the allocation period is completed, the CSV file is exported and the GIVE values are converted to BANK before being loaded to Gnosis and the details of the transactions posted on Discord.\n11. The Grants Committee then approves the multisig for payment in 1 - 2 days.\n\n**Guild/Project Coordinape Round**\n\nThe guild/project Coordinape round is specific to each guild. It could be at the end of every month or at the end of a season (three month period within which focused work is done). For this round, only those who are a part of the guild running the round can join the circle. Usually, leaders of these guilds add contributors to guild circles and at any time contributors allocate GIVE to fellow contributors, routine tasks are carried out by the community to ensure that only active contributors get rewarded for work done.\n\nFor the round to take place, the following steps need to be taken for the smooth allocation of tokens to contributors.\n\n1. Set up a Google Form or a Tally depending on the guild\n2. Get members to sign up on the forms and submit information such as Discord handle and wallet address. They can also provide information about whether they have been actively contributing and what they have done within the period\n3. Go to Coordinape and create the epoch (the round) by clicking on ‘Create Epoch’ (This is assuming you are an admin and the circle has been set up before now).\n\n![alt_text](images/image2.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n4. Set the duration and the start date of the epoch (allocation period).\n5. Upon creation of the epoch, confirm that the members listed are the same as those on the submission form.\n6. If a contributor changes their wallet address, then use the ‘action’ button to edit the details or even remove members from the list.\n\n![alt_text](images/image3.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n7. You can as well add contributors by clicking on the ‘Add Contributor’ button and inputting the access level of the contributor.\n\n![alt_text](images/image4.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n8. Once the process is complete, announce on Discord at several times and wait for the epoch to begin.\n9. At the end of the allocation period, click on the ‘Export CSV’ button and calculate the number of BANK to be received based on the number of GIVE tokens owned by each contributor.\n\n![alt_text](images/image5.png \"image_tooltip\")",

The first video in the videos section explains how to set up Coordinape on Bankless DAO\n\n2. Fill in the details of the form and wait for allocation to begin.

          "shortTitle": "Background",
          "details": "[DIA (Decentralized Information Asset)](https://www.diadata.org/) is a multi-chain oracle that connects decentralized applications to multiple data sources. It receives data from multiple sources on various Blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, etc., stores the data in one location and provides the data to other solutions (DApps) that need them. So, rather than trying to connect to multiple sources directly which could be expensive to manage and difficult to build, DApps can connect to DIA and have access to these data based on what is needed. The interesting thing to note is that DIA has made this process very simple that if you need token prices, chart data, or other use cases as part of the features of your application, then you can simply generate them from DIA.\n\n[DIA DAO](https://dao.diadata.org/) is a decentralized organization that builds and manages DIA. It is decentralized in that there is a community of people who work together without any central leadership that takes decisions on their behalf. In fact, the community itself takes decisions on behalf of the DAO via governance processes such as voting on proposals. The DAO is focused on three main goals as it moves towards becoming a fully decentralized organization. They are:\n\n* Product/Platform Development\n* Community Ownership and Governance\n* Awareness and Engagement\n\nThe essence of these three goals is to allow the DAO to provide its core proposition to its users by constantly working on the product and expanding the features to increase the utility of the platform while creating an environment for ownership in the community. So, people can own tokens in the DAO, invest their time to structure the DAO properly, and ultimately guide the DAO to success. Finally, the community can join hands in getting people to know about the DAO and its products which should drive traction and encourage more people to join the DAO.\n\nDIA DAO provides incentives to anyone who joins the DAO and seeks to use their time and skills to advance the project such as earning rewards in Ethereum (ETH) for work done, Experience Points (XP) for special rewards, and DIA tokens as well. These layers of rewards have been put in place to encourage contributors to work hard in ensuring that the goals highlighted above are met and success is achieved. Divided into guilds, members of the DAO can work with other people with similar skills in one or more guilds depending on the level of skills possessed by the contributor and apart from the obvious rewards, other incentives for joining are getting a reputation in the web3 economy, connecting and networking with peers, being on the frontline of the future of work, learning and developing new skills, co-creating the data layer of the web3 economy, and shaping the future of DIA DAO."

          "shortTitle": "Guilds and Roles",
          "details": "**Guilds**\n\nDIA DAO has made it possible for contributors to collaborate with one another to get work done. The coordination of work is made possible by guilds which are small units where people are put together based on skills/functional areas. In DIA DAO, there are six (6) guilds, and they are listed below:\n\n* Design\n* Growth & Promo\n* Copywriting\n* Business Development\n* Operations\n* Tech\n\nThese guilds have their unique purposes and based on their names, it is clear what each of them is for. The design guild is tasked with creating unique visual assets such as graphics and videos across the DAO to enable clear communication both within and outside the DAO. The Growth & Promo guild works to promote the DAO on various channels while creating a system that will foster the growth of the DAO. The copywriting guild is the content bank of the DAO. They develop great written content in form of articles, blog posts, copies, books, etc. that communicates what the DAO is doing per time and also educational content to teach people about multi-chain oracles and web3 in general. The business development guild handles the adoption of the products/services provided by DIA by identifying users while the operations guild manages onboarding processes, evaluating work, and distributing rewards. Finally, the tech guild builds the core products of the DAO.\n\n**Roles**\n\nAs the DAO is divided into guilds, so are the roles in the DAO and irrespective of the guild a contributor is in, the roles must be within the three categories available. The three roles for contributors in DIA DAO include:\n\n* DAO Contributor\n* DAO Ambassador\n* DAO Leader\n\nThe role occupied by a member of the DAO is dependent on the level they are in the DAO. As an approved contributor, you are automatically a DAO Contributor and that tag will be given in Discord as well. They handle all types of tasks in the DAO as they form the majority of contributors in the DAO. DAO Ambassadors are one step ahead and they carry out specific functions such as hosting events across the world, running local communities, and other responsibilities as they come. Finally, DAO Leaders serve as managers in different capacities. They are native to the DAO and understand what DIA is trying to achieve in the long run. They also shape the direction of the DAO, take up duties, manage processes, coordinate work, and facilitate growth in the DAO."

          "shortTitle": "Compensation",
          "details": "Contributors join DAOs so they can give their time and skills to the growth of the DAO and in return get rewarded for doing that. In DIA DAO, this is the case as people get rewards after completing tasks assigned to them to work on. The tool for managing tasks and getting rewarded on DIA DAO is Dework. With Dework, DIA DAO is able to develop tasks, assign them, get them evaluated and reward the contributor for work done. This clear process for managing contributors from onboarding to compensation in DIA DAO is discussed below.\n\n**Onboarding**\n\nPeople interested in joining the DAO will have to sign up by joining Discord and following the process below:\n\n1. Verify yourself in the **[#📌｜verify](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)** channel by following the prompt.\n\n2. Get to the  **[#🌐｜info-center](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)** channel.\n\n3. Apply to become a contributor by clicking on this [link](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Application) and follow the instructions on the page. Once the application is reviewed and approved, the role **#DAO-Applicant** is assigned.\n\n4. As a **#DAO-Applicant**, it is time to prove yourself. To do this, [choose the guild](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Guilds) that you are willing to join and complete their onboarding task. An example is the onboarding task for the copywriting guild which is to write a blog post on “What is DIA?”. Take a look at the task [here](https://app.dework.xyz/dia-dao/copywriting-guild-l4nawag6?taskId=f87d63ab-1095-40e5-abf5-f7f7b6c8a731).\n\n5. Upon completion of the task, if the guild leader finds your work interesting, you’ll be added to the guild and be given the **#DAO-Contributor **role and be added to the guild on Discord.\n\n**Complete Tasks**\n\nThe next step as a **#DAO-Contributor** is to be active in the community and be on the lookout for tasks. Periodically, the guild leader will post bounties for everyone in the guild to apply to. The following process is followed for every task in DIA DAO.\n\n1. A bounty is posted by the leader of the guild on Dework and Discord\n2. Members apply to the bounty by following the instructions stated\n3. Once at least 3 contributors apply to the bounty, it is then assigned to one or more of the contributors depending on what is needed\n4. When the work is complete, the task is evaluated\n\n**Compensation**\n\nAfter a task has been completed, evaluated, and approved, then the contributor who did the work is due for compensation. The rewards for contribution are usually in ETH and XP. While ETH is the direct monetary reward, XP is also given for every task as a way to increase boosters for contributors and even give them access to better tasks in the future as it increases. XP can also be exchanged for DIA tokens. \n\nThere are other rewards for tasks such as DIA tokens for some special tasks that will be impactful to the DAO in the long run. Also, NFT badges are rewards that are earned by the contributors for completing tasks. An example is the NFT badge that is received when a contributor completes the onboarding task."

          "title": "How is DIA DAO using Dework?",
          "shortTitle": "Tool: Dework",
          "details": "Dework is a web3 native tool for managing projects end to end. It facilitates collaboration among teams, tracks work progress, and makes token payments easy to achieve. In this process, DAOs can have a workflow for their contributors from the beginning of a task to when they receive rewards for work done. So, based on the structure of DIA DAO, Dework is the tool of choice for managing various processes that involve contributors in the DAO. There are a number of ways that DIA DAO is making use of Dework to make coordination simple and efficient and they are highlighted below:\n\n* Role Management\n* Leaderboard\n* Task Management\n* Combined Board\n\n**Role Management**\n\nOn DIA DAO, while there are generalized roles (such as DAO Applicant, DAO Contributor, DAO Ambassador, and DAO Leader), there are specific roles associated with the different guilds that a contributor is a part of. An example of this is; In the copywriting guild, the role of a contributor is known as **#DAO-Copywriter**. So, depending on the number of roles a contributor has, DIA DAO makes it clear to everyone the roles that they are in and what they have access to. In making this very explicit, DIA DAO has a board on Dework that shows the contributor the available roles and what roles the contributor has. \n\nTo see the roles on Dework, open DIA DAO on Dework and click on roles (this assumed that you are now a contributor on Dework).\n\n![alt_text](images/image1.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\nFrom the image above, you’ll see the roles the contributor has access to greyed out while the roles yet to be received are active. With this, every contributor has a clear view of what they can work on based on the roles they hold.\n\n**Leaderboard**\n\nDIA DAO has a leaderboard as a way to rank contributors for work done in the DAO. The ranking is a result of the accumulated XP (experience points) a contributor earns. The way it works is that for every bounty completed by a contributor, there is a stipulated Dollar reward paid in ETH and XP. So, while the contributor gets the ETH, the XP is used to rank the contributor in the DAO. These points earned can give the contributor access to more work as trust has been earned and the cycle continues. The calculation for how much XP should be earned for a given task is explained in the table below:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Dollar Value\n   </td>\n   <td>XP Multiple\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>$0 - $100\n   </td>\n   <td>10x Dollar Value\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>$101 - $200\n   </td>\n   <td>5x Dollar Value\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>$201+\n   </td>\n   <td>1x Dollar Value\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nAn example of this is if there are two bounties, the first has a reward of $150 and the second $600, the XP earned will be 1250 XP (($100 x 10) + ($50 x 5)) for the first and 1900 XP (($100 x 10) + ($100 x 5) + ($400 x 1)) for the second one.\n\nThere are two types of leaderboards (weekly and monthly) and they have rewards for those who make it to the top of the boards. The weekly leaderboard runs from Friday 10 AM - Friday 9:59 AM and the reward (paid in XP via Dework) is stated below:\n\n* 1st: 500 XP\n* 2nd: 300 XP\n* 3rd: 200 XP\n\nA sample of the weekly board as seen on Dework is shown below:\n\n![alt_text](images/image2.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\nThe monthly leaderboard runs from the first day of the month to the last day of the month and the reward (paid in ETH via Dework) is stated below:\n\n* 1st: 100$\n* 2nd: 50$\n* 3rd: 30$\n* 4th: 20$\n* 5th: 10$\n\nThe image below shows an example of the leaderboard on Dework\n\n![alt_text](images/image3.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\n**Task Management**\n\nTasks in DIA DAO are structured in form of bounties which are work to be completed by the community by selecting the person(s) to work on it after vetting submitted proposals by contributors. The process for this is provided below\n\n1. The leader of a guild publishes the bounty with the reward associated with it on Dework and Discord and clear instructions on what the proposal should look like and the expectations from completing the bounty will be stated. \n\n![alt_text](images/image4.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\n2. With this information, contributors will submit their proposals on Dework as well and the best is chosen to work on the bounty. \n3. After the work is completed, the payment is made to the contributor via Dework.\n\n**Combined Board**\n\nThe combined board shows all the bounties across the DAO that are in the backlog, in progress, and done. Every contributor can have a good view of what is on the board and also what has been assigned. The image below shows the combined Board of DIA DAO on Dework.\n\n![alt_text](images/image5.jpg \"image_tooltip\")"
