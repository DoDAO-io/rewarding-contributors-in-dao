          "details": "Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are decentralized networks that are run by a set of rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain. In order for DAOs to maintain the network, they require contributors. These contributors typically provide resources to help the DAO operate and function properly. They also provide the required skills needed to perform various functions within the DAO such as developing products, managing communities, onboarding users, and building the brand. Additionally, they may also participate in decision-making processes within the DAO, helping to shape its direction and determine how it should operate. Without contributors, a DAO would not be able to function effectively, as it would lack the necessary resources and input from its members. This [article](https://mirror.xyz/roseight.eth/NgnPgGoeB3It6xXttXwssopFftaolgHH3AoJeSG4giI) shows some things both DAOs and contributors can do to ease the process of contributing to the DAO.\n\nAs DAOs grow, there is usually an increase in the number of contributors to the DAO. These contributors get to set how they want to work and the length of time they want to give to the DAO. DAOs also measure the work done by contributors so they can track progress and reward them accordingly. However, there could be some challenges with tracking the quality of work done by contributors. Sometimes, even though a DAO may have a large number of contributors, there may be little work done if people are not clear on what they are to work on or even understand what is happening in the DAO at the time.\n\nAlso, contributors want to be rewarded for work done in the DAO. This means giving them some form of payment for tasks, projects, or bounties completed. The conversations about rewarding contributors are evolving just as DAOs are. DAOs need to consider what type of work should be rewarded, the value of the reward that is fair, the rewards structures that are in place, and so on. This guide explains some approaches to take in measuring contributions in DAOs to ensure that contributors are rewarded efficiently.\n\n### **Measuring Contributions in DAOs**\n\nWhen people join DAOs, they do so with the intention of contributing to the DAO and getting rewarded afterward. However, there are many cases where people join DAO communities on Discord and feel left out mostly because there is a high amount of engagement on different things going on in the DAO and not enough clear path for people to know how to contribute. \n\nTo efficiently measure contributions, there are a number of things to have in place. They include:\n\n* Create a simple procedure to onboard contributors\n* Enabling environment for contributors\n* Define the work structure\n* Setting a clear KPI\n\n**Onboarding Contributors**\n\nMany DAOs do not have a defined process for onboarding contributors other than just joining Discord so this makes it really difficult for people to blend in with the community. Many people do not go through the pain of figuring things out by themselves so they join the community and do not do anything meaningful. Creating a system for contributors to follow in order to contribute to the DAO gives the DAO access to quality contributors who know exactly how they want to contribute.\n\n**Enabling Environment for Contributors**\n\nThis is key for every DAO since the environment created determines the level of energy contributors will bring when functioning within the DAO. People should be able to ask questions about processes and products and be sure to get answers. Today, DAOs are constantly in need of contributors because contributors get tired easily and many times, stop working. So, in addition to the flexibility that DAOs bring naturally, a good environment will help the DAO get quality and helpful contributions that will rank high when measured.\n\n**Work Structure**\n\nSince DAOs are flexible, contributors can decide when and what to work on depending on the availability of tasks or functions. However, a good structure of both core contributors and other contributors can help the DAO achieve its goals. If the DAO has only part-time contributors who work at their own convenience, then the majority of the work that needs to be done may never get done since there is no one to primarily hold responsible for those duties. Also, if there are only core contributors, then the idea of decentralization in DAOs will be defeated. So, a balance of both is necessary for growth in the DAO.\n\n**Setting KPIs**\n\nOnce a contributor goes through the process and is confirmed, the next thing to ensure that the contributions are measured well is to set clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for different functions or skill areas. Contributors should know what the KPIs are and should be dedicated to achieving them. When contributors turn in their work, the community can decide on the quality of work done based on the KPI set for it. This way, every work is measured against a KPI or a north star metric and people are encouraged to do their best work.\n\n### **Reward Structure**\n\nDetermining the rewards for contributions made in a DAO can be tricky. Oftentimes, DAOs want to ensure that people who are compensated actually do great work for the DAO and contributors want to feel adequately rewarded for work done. To get a good understanding of the different reward structures, including their pros and cons, read this [article](https://gasless.substack.com/p/understanding-dao-incentives-and).\n\nSome of the structures for rewarding contributors in DAOs include:\n\n* Funding Proposals\n* Collective Rewards\n* Token rewards\n* Grants\n* Bounties\n\n**Funding Proposals**\n\nContributors can request funds as rewards for work done over a given period of time from the DAO. For this, it is expected that the work would have been approved to be done with a number of KPIs stated to determine the completion of the work. Also, an associated amount should have been approved for the work to be done. Hence, once the work is done, the contributor can then put up a proposal to receive the funds stipulated for the task(s).\n\n**Collective Rewards**\n\nRewards are kept aside for contributors based on how valuable their work is to other contributors. If it is found to be highly valuable, then a predetermined amount is given to the contributor. This is to encourage people to put their best foot forward when carrying out a task in the DAO. \n\n**Token Rewards**\n\nAs contributors put their skills forward to develop a DAO, a way to reward them is to make them have a sense of ownership by rewarding them with DAO tokens. When contributors are rewarded this way, they are given the power to easily vote on decisions made in the DAO. So, aside from doing great work, they can create proposals and even influence the direction of the DAO through their votes.\n\n**Grants**\n\nThere are cases where complex projects may be needed in a DAO or other DAOs may want to build on the progress of a bigger DAO by leveraging their technology to create new experiences. The DAO can set up a grant program to which people can apply to fund those complex projects. Many times, these projects are external and other times are led by contributors of the DAO.\n\n**Bounties**\n\nThese are rewards for specific tasks with well-defined completion criteria that DAOs open up for the public to work on. The work is usually associated with a fixed reward and anyone who completes the task gets the reward.",

          "details": "Bankless DAO is focused on onboarding 1 Billion people to web3. It does this by building the media rails required for people to learn about the crypto space. By leveraging the power of community, Bankless DAO is solving the problem of coordination, creating wealth for many people, and making it easy for people to understand what web3 is and how to be a part of it. Through developing written and audio media content, building DAO tooling platforms, providing consultancy to other communities, and giving scholarships to people interested in learning web3, Bankless DAO is creating the channels for increasing crypto adoption across the world.\n\nBankless DAO is built on three core values; Education, Culture, and Decentralized Governance. Learning is at the heart of adoption in the web3 space. So, educating one another with accurate information irrespective of the media of communication is integral to what Bankless DAO is building. So far, articles, podcasts, videos, and forum discussions are some of the ways people in the community learn to educate one another on DeFi, DAOs, and web3 in general. Also, Bankless DAO is building a culture of self-organizing systems where the community comes up with new initiatives that drive the growth of the DAO. It is a culture that rewards action-takers and encourages risks. This is because, without risks, there is no reward. Finally, decision-making is not done by a select few but by the collective by implementing decentralized governance where every token holder in the community has a say in the decisions taken in the DAO.\n\nA number of projects have been executed by the community to foster growth and build relationships in the DAO. Some of the projects include:\n\n* [Bankless Consulting](https://www.banklessconsulting.com/): A service that connects over 15,000 web3 talents to professional services in various work areas such as tech, marketing, finance, legal, and management.\n\n* [Degen Project](https://bankless.notion.site/DEGEN-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8): A discord bot that carries out administrative functions across Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Podcast Hatchery](https://bankless.notion.site/Podcast-Hatchery-0c2676175267445180c8f5cb3d3f14bb): A podcast that empowers creators to start their own podcast, improve their production skills, and grow an audio-based audience as they share knowledge on web3 thereby living out the vision of Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Bankless Loans](https://bankless.notion.site/Bankless-Loans-c6b90fad24b24312b184840e49694f7f): This is a DeFi application that provides loans as a way for the DAO to generate revenue for its treasury.\n\n* [Bankless Academy](https://app.banklessacademy.com/): This is an application that teaches people with little or no knowledge of crypto to become competent crypto users.\n\nThere are more projects in Bankless DAO and they all contribute to achieving the mission of onboarding 1 Billion people to the web3 space.\n\nFinally, Bankless DAO has a governance token (BANK) which it uses to vote on decisions made in the DAO. Holders of the token are community members and they collaborate to see that Bankless continues to grow and is positioned to be a massive success."

          "details": "[Guilds](https://www.bankless.community/about-us/guilds) are the structures for contribution in Bankless DAO. This is how contributors are clustered based on skills, areas of interest, and professional backgrounds to achieve a common goal. In each guild, contributors work with one another to incubate ideas and also perform cross-functional activities to provide support where necessary DAO-wide. There are various guilds in Bankless DAO, namely:\n\n* Analytics Guild\n* Audiovisual Guild\n* DAOlationships Guild\n* Design Guild\n* Developers Guild\n* Education Guild\n* Legal Guild\n* Marketing Guild\n* Operations Guild\n* Research Guild\n* Treasury Guild\n* Translators Guild\n* Writers Guild\n\nThe analytics guild uses data to provide insights and build data-based products for the DAO. The audiovisual guild creates audio and video content for the DAO, and the DAOlationships guild builds partnerships with other organizations and communities. \n\nThe design guild creates designs for the DAO, the developers guild builds tools and provides developer education, and the education guild provides educational materials on web3 and related topics. \n\nThe legal guild handles legal issues and education on legal structures for web3 organizations, the marketing guild uses marketing initiatives to promote the DAO, and the operations guild handles day-to-day administrative tasks. \n\nThe research guild conducts research and documentation, the treasury guild manages the financial resources of the DAO, the translators guild publicizes the DAO's work in different languages, and the writers guild handles writing projects for the DAO.

          "shortTitle": "Compensation",
          "details": "Bankless DAO as other DAOs has contributors working in various guilds to ensure the sustainable growth of the DAO. When these contributors give their time and skills to the DAO, they are rewarded for work done and time spent working on different projects. A common situation for DAOs is thinking about the right way to compensate contributors in a fair manner especially when they are many. For Bankless DAO, the tool used for coordinating compensation is known as [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/).\n\nOn Coordinape, the compensation is done by community members and not the core team. This is so that, other contributors who have seen the impact of their fellow contributors decide who gets compensated. It solves the problem of bias as you only get rewarded if you collaborate with others and they can clearly see that you have done some work. This process of gifting one another tokens based on contributions is done via Gift Circles and what is either given or received is known as GIVE. The GIVE token is the native token used by Coordinape to vote for one another and to be able to either give or receive, a person must be a part of the circle.\n\nThere are three types of contributors that can be rewarded in Bankless DAO using Coordinape; L1 members, L2 members, and guest pass holders. L1 members are those who own at least 35,000 BANK or an equivalent of LP tokens from certified AMMs. L2 members are contributors that have been nominated and voted into leadership roles due to their level of dedication and hardwork in the DAO while guest pass holders are contributors that are active in the DAO but do not have enough BANK tokens. \n\nL1 and L2 members can either give or receive GIVE depending on the circle they are in. However, guest pass holders can only receive. At the end of every epoch (the period it takes for gifting to occur), the GIVE tokens that have been shared by the contributors will be converted into a BANK token which is the native token for Bankless DAO and is sent to all contributors’ wallets. The conversion from GIVE to BANK tokens is dependent on the number of BANK tokens in supply. If there are 1,000 BANK tokens open for supply and a contributor gets  1,000 GIVE tokens out of 10,000 GIVE tokens, then 1,000 GIVE becomes 10% of the total tokens available. 10% multiplied by 1,000 BANK tokens equals 100 BANK tokens.",

          "details": "Coordinape being the central compensation platform on Bankless DAO is used to distribute tokens on a monthly basis. The process for distribution is known as a Coordinape round which is a monthly period where GIVE tokens are allocated to contributors. Each round goes through four stages before it is completed.\n\n1. Submission: Every member of the DAO submits a form with relevant information such as their Discord ID,  wallet address, membership type, and other necessary information requested by the DAO.\n2. Upload to Coordinape: Upon submission by active contributors for the month, the admin takes the information submitted and uploads it to their respective Coordinape circles.\n3. Allocation Period: After the upload is completed, contributors will now be able to choose other contributors to gift as a way of compensating them for work done in that month.\n4. Payout: At the end of the round the grants committee will allocate BANK tokens to contributors based on the number of GIVE received in that round.\n\nThere are two rounds through which Bankless DAO uses Coordinape to distribute compensation in form of rounds. These rounds are highlighted below:\n\n* Bankless DAO Coordinape Round\n* Guild/Project Coordinape Round\n\n**Bankless DAO Coordinape Round**\n\nThis is a monthly round that occurs across the DAO to compensate contributors for that month. In this round, contributors are placed in the L1, L2, or Guest Pass Circle.\n\nFor L1 circle, L1 members can both give and receive from other contributors, L2 can only give and guest pass cannot be on this circle. For L2 circle, L1 members can only give, L2 members can both give and receive while guest pass cannot join this circle. Finally, for the guest pass circle, both L1 and L2 members can only give while guest pass members can only receive. \n\n* L1 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L1 can receive\n* L2 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L2 can receive\n* Guest Pass Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only Guest Pass can receive\n\nFor clarity, the table below highlights the different circles and their responsibilities.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td>L1 Circle\n   </td>\n   <td>L2 Circle\n   </td>\n   <td>Guest Pass Circle\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>L1 Members\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give and Receive\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>L2 Members\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give and Receive\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Guest Pass Holders\n   </td>\n   <td>Not Allowed\n   </td>\n   <td>Not Allowed\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Receive Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nWhen organizing the round, the primary coordinator handles the process and there are certain steps that are required.\n\n1. A calendar is set up months ahead with dates for each round. A sample is shown below:\n\n![Coordinape Round Calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/CoordinapeRoundCalendar.jpg \"Coordinape Round Calendar\")\n\n2. Set up three Google forms for L1, L2, and guest pass circles. \n3. Ensure Degen is synced with the forms by going to the #degen-general channel on Discord and asking the team to load up the three forms for distribution.\n4. Submit the form links to the Degen team\n5. Test the form in #bot-commands channel on Discord to confirm that the automation is live before the submission period begins.\n6. Announce the submission period on Discord, Community Calls, and Weekly Newsletters continuously for at least one week before the date.\n7. Open the links for submissions while still announcing.\n8. Hand over the data 1 - 2 days before submission ends so that the team can give Coordnipae ample time to bulk upload the data from the forms.\n9. Announce the allocation period to community members once uploading is completed. \n10. Once the allocation period is completed, the CSV file is exported and the GIVE values are converted to BANK before being loaded to Gnosis and the details of the transactions posted on Discord.\n11. The Grants Committee then approves the multisig for payment in 1 - 2 days.\n\n**Guild/Project Coordinape Round**\n\nThe guild/project Coordinape round is specific to each guild. It could be at the end of every month or at the end of a season (three month period within which focused work is done). For this round, only those who are a part of the guild running the round can join the circle. Usually, leaders of these guilds add contributors to guild circles and at any time contributors allocate GIVE to fellow contributors, routine tasks are carried out by the community to ensure that only active contributors get rewarded for work done.\n\nFor the round to take place, the following steps need to be taken for the smooth allocation of tokens to contributors.\n\n1. Set up a Google Form or a Tally depending on the guild\n2. Get members to sign up on the forms and submit information such as Discord handle and wallet address. They can also provide information about whether they have been actively contributing and what they have done within the period\n3. Go to Coordinape and create the epoch (the round) by clicking on ‘Create Epoch’ (This is assuming you are an admin and the circle has been set up before now).\n\n![Create Epoch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Coordinape_Create_Epoch.png \"Create Epoch\")\n\n4. Set the duration and the start date of the epoch (allocation period).\n5. Upon creation of the epoch, confirm that the members listed are the same as those on the submission form.\n6. If a contributor changes their wallet address, then use the ‘action’ button to edit the details or even remove members from the list.\n\n![Coordinape Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Coordinape_Actions.png \"Coordinape Actions\")\n\n7. You can as well add contributors by clicking on the ‘Add Contributor’ button and inputting the access level of the contributor.\n\n![Add Contributor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Coordinape_Add_Contributor.png \"Add Contributor\")\n\n8. Once the process is complete, announce on Discord at several times and wait for the epoch to begin.\n9. At the end of the allocation period, click on the ‘Export CSV’ button and calculate the number of BANK to be received based on the number of GIVE tokens owned by each contributor.\n\n![Export CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Coordinape_exportCSV.png \"Export CSV\")",

          "shortTitle": "Background",
          "details": "[DIA (Decentralized Information Asset)](https://www.diadata.org/) is a multi-chain oracle that connects decentralized applications to multiple data sources. It receives data from multiple sources on various Blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, etc., stores the data in one location and provides the data to other solutions (DApps) that need them. So, rather than trying to connect to multiple sources directly which could be expensive to manage and difficult to build, DApps can connect to DIA and have access to these data based on what is needed. The interesting thing to note is that DIA has made this process very simple that if you need token prices, chart data, or other use cases as part of the features of your application, then you can simply generate them from DIA.\n\n[DIA DAO](https://dao.diadata.org/) is a decentralized organization that builds and manages DIA. It is decentralized in that there is a community of people who work together without any central leadership that takes decisions on their behalf. In fact, the community itself takes decisions on behalf of the DAO via governance processes such as voting on proposals. The DAO is focused on three main goals as it moves towards becoming a fully decentralized organization. They are:\n\n* Product/Platform Development\n* Community Ownership and Governance\n* Awareness and Engagement\n\nThe essence of these three goals is to allow the DAO to provide its core proposition to its users by constantly working on the product and expanding the features to increase the utility of the platform while creating an environment for ownership in the community. So, people can own tokens in the DAO, invest their time to structure the DAO properly, and ultimately guide the DAO to success. Finally, the community can join hands in getting people to know about the DAO and its products which should drive traction and encourage more people to join the DAO.\n\nDIA DAO provides incentives to anyone who joins the DAO and seeks to use their time and skills to advance the project such as earning rewards in Ethereum (ETH) for work done, Experience Points (XP) for special rewards, and DIA tokens as well. These layers of rewards have been put in place to encourage contributors to work hard in ensuring that the goals highlighted above are met and success is achieved. Divided into guilds, members of the DAO can work with other people with similar skills in one or more guilds depending on the level of skills possessed by the contributor and apart from the obvious rewards, other incentives for joining are getting a reputation in the web3 economy, connecting and networking with peers, being on the frontline of the future of work, learning and developing new skills, co-creating the data layer of the web3 economy, and shaping the future of DIA DAO."

          "shortTitle": "Guilds and Roles",
          "details": "**Guilds**\n\nDIA DAO has made it possible for contributors to collaborate with one another to get work done. The coordination of work is made possible by guilds which are small units where people are put together based on skills/functional areas. In DIA DAO, there are six (6) guilds, and they are listed below:\n\n* Design\n* Growth & Promo\n* Copywriting\n* Business Development\n* Operations\n* Tech\n\nThese guilds have their unique purposes and based on their names, it is clear what each of them is for. The design guild is tasked with creating unique visual assets such as graphics and videos across the DAO to enable clear communication both within and outside the DAO. The Growth & Promo guild works to promote the DAO on various channels while creating a system that will foster the growth of the DAO. The copywriting guild is the content bank of the DAO. They develop great written content in form of articles, blog posts, copies, books, etc. that communicates what the DAO is doing per time and also educational content to teach people about multi-chain oracles and web3 in general. The business development guild handles the adoption of the products/services provided by DIA by identifying users while the operations guild manages onboarding processes, evaluating work, and distributing rewards. Finally, the tech guild builds the core products of the DAO.\n\n**Roles**\n\nAs the DAO is divided into guilds, so are the roles in the DAO and irrespective of the guild a contributor is in, the roles must be within the three categories available. The three roles for contributors in DIA DAO include:\n\n* DAO Contributor\n* DAO Ambassador\n* DAO Leader\n\nThe role occupied by a member of the DAO is dependent on the level they are in the DAO. As an approved contributor, you are automatically a DAO Contributor and that tag will be given in Discord as well. They handle all types of tasks in the DAO as they form the majority of contributors in the DAO. DAO Ambassadors are one step ahead and they carry out specific functions such as hosting events across the world, running local communities, and other responsibilities as they come. Finally, DAO Leaders serve as managers in different capacities. They are native to the DAO and understand what DIA is trying to achieve in the long run. They also shape the direction of the DAO, take up duties, manage processes, coordinate work, and facilitate growth in the DAO."

          "shortTitle": "Compensation",
          "details": "Contributors join DAOs so they can give their time and skills to the growth of the DAO and in return get rewarded for doing that. In DIA DAO, this is the case as people get rewards after completing tasks assigned to them to work on. The tool for managing tasks and getting rewarded on DIA DAO is Dework. With Dework, DIA DAO is able to develop tasks, assign them, get them evaluated and reward the contributor for work done. This clear process for managing contributors from onboarding to compensation in DIA DAO is discussed below.\n\n**Onboarding**\n\nPeople interested in joining the DAO will have to sign up by joining Discord and following the process below:\n\n1. Verify yourself in the **[#📌｜verify](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)** channel by following the prompt.\n\n2. Get to the  **[#🌐｜info-center](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)** channel.\n\n3. Apply to become a contributor by clicking on this [link](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Application) and follow the instructions on the page. Once the application is reviewed and approved, the role **#DAO-Applicant** is assigned.\n\n4. As a **#DAO-Applicant**, it is time to prove yourself. To do this, [choose the guild](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Guilds) that you are willing to join and complete their onboarding task. An example is the onboarding task for the copywriting guild which is to write a blog post on “What is DIA?”. Take a look at the task [here](https://app.dework.xyz/dia-dao/copywriting-guild-l4nawag6?taskId=f87d63ab-1095-40e5-abf5-f7f7b6c8a731).\n\n5. Upon completion of the task, if the guild leader finds your work interesting, you’ll be added to the guild and be given the **#DAO-Contributor **role and be added to the guild on Discord.\n\n**Complete Tasks**\n\nThe next step as a **#DAO-Contributor** is to be active in the community and be on the lookout for tasks. Periodically, the guild leader will post bounties for everyone in the guild to apply to. The following process is followed for every task in DIA DAO.\n\n1. A bounty is posted by the leader of the guild on Dework and Discord\n2. Members apply to the bounty by following the instructions stated\n3. Once at least 3 contributors apply to the bounty, it is then assigned to one or more of the contributors depending on what is needed\n4. When the work is complete, the task is evaluated\n\n**Compensation**\n\nAfter a task has been completed, evaluated, and approved, then the contributor who did the work is due for compensation. The rewards for contribution are usually in ETH and XP. While ETH is the direct monetary reward, XP is also given for every task as a way to increase boosters for contributors and even give them access to better tasks in the future as it increases. XP can also be exchanged for DIA tokens. \n\nThere are other rewards for tasks such as DIA tokens for some special tasks that will be impactful to the DAO in the long run. Also, NFT badges are rewards that are earned by the contributors for completing tasks. An example is the NFT badge that is received when a contributor completes the onboarding task."

          "shortTitle": "Tool: Dework",
          "details": "Dework is a web3 native tool for managing projects end to end. It facilitates collaboration among teams, tracks work progress, and makes token payments easy to achieve. In this process, DAOs can have a workflow for their contributors from the beginning of a task to when they receive rewards for work done. So, based on the structure of DIA DAO, Dework is the tool of choice for managing various processes that involve contributors in the DAO. There are a number of ways that DIA DAO is making use of Dework to make coordination simple and efficient and they are highlighted below:\n\n* Role Management\n* Leaderboard\n* Task Management\n* Combined Board\n\n**Role Management**\n\nOn DIA DAO, while there are generalized roles (such as DAO Applicant, DAO Contributor, DAO Ambassador, and DAO Leader), there are specific roles associated with the different guilds that a contributor is a part of. An example of this is; In the copywriting guild, the role of a contributor is known as **#DAO-Copywriter**. So, depending on the number of roles a contributor has, DIA DAO makes it clear to everyone the roles that they are in and what they have access to. In making this very explicit, DIA DAO has a board on Dework that shows the contributor the available roles and what roles the contributor has. \n\nTo see the roles on Dework, open DIA DAO on Dework and click on roles (this assumed that you are now a contributor on Dework).\n\n![dework roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Roles_on_Dework.jpg \"Dework roles\")\n\nFrom the image above, you’ll see the roles the contributor has access to greyed out while the roles yet to be received are active. With this, every contributor has a clear view of what they can work on based on the roles they hold.\n\n**Leaderboard**\n\nDIA DAO has a leaderboard as a way to rank contributors for work done in the DAO. The ranking is a result of the accumulated XP (experience points) a contributor earns. The way it works is that for every bounty completed by a contributor, there is a stipulated Dollar reward paid in ETH and XP. So, while the contributor gets the ETH, the XP is used to rank the contributor in the DAO. These points earned can give the contributor access to more work as trust has been earned and the cycle continues. The calculation for how much XP should be earned for a given task is explained in the table below:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Dollar Value\n   </td>\n   <td>XP Multiple\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>$0 - $100\n   </td>\n   <td>10x Dollar Value\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>$101 - $200\n   </td>\n   <td>5x Dollar Value\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>$201+\n   </td>\n   <td>1x Dollar Value\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nAn example of this is if there are two bounties, the first has a reward of $150 and the second $600, the XP earned will be 1250 XP (($100 x 10) + ($50 x 5)) for the first and 1900 XP (($100 x 10) + ($100 x 5) + ($400 x 1)) for the second one.\n\nThere are two types of leaderboards (weekly and monthly) and they have rewards for those who make it to the top of the boards. The weekly leaderboard runs from Friday 10 AM - Friday 9:59 AM and the reward (paid in XP via Dework) is stated below:\n\n* 1st: 500 XP\n* 2nd: 300 XP\n* 3rd: 200 XP\n\nA sample of the weekly board as seen on Dework is shown below:\n\n![weekly leaderboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Weekly_leaderboard.jpg \"weekly leaderboard\")\n\nThe monthly leaderboard runs from the first day of the month to the last day of the month and the reward (paid in ETH via Dework) is stated below:\n\n* 1st: 100$\n* 2nd: 50$\n* 3rd: 30$\n* 4th: 20$\n* 5th: 10$\n\nThe image below shows an example of the leaderboard on Dework\n\n![monthly leaderboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Monthly_Leaderboard.jpg \"monthly leaderboard\")\n\n**Task Management**\n\nTasks in DIA DAO are structured in form of bounties which are work to be completed by the community by selecting the person(s) to work on it after vetting submitted proposals by contributors. The process for this is provided below\n\n1. The leader of a guild publishes the bounty with the reward associated with it on Dework and Discord and clear instructions on what the proposal should look like and the expectations from completing the bounty will be stated. \n\n![sample bounty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/Sample_bounty.jpg \"sample bounty\")\n\n2. With this information, contributors will submit their proposals on Dework as well and the best is chosen to work on the bounty. \n3. After the work is completed, the payment is made to the contributor via Dework.\n\n**Combined Board**\n\nThe combined board shows all the bounties across the DAO that are in the backlog, in progress, and done. Every contributor can have a good view of what is on the board and also what has been assigned. The image below shows the combined Board of DIA DAO on Dework.\n\n![combined board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/CombinedBoard.jpg \"combined board\")",

          "details": "[Arrow](https://www.arrowair.com/) is a web3 native open-source community that is focused on the future of air mobility by building the infrastructure required for anyone to be able to move from one point to another on earth. The goal is to build vertical takeoff aircraft that are affordable and can be accessed by anyone via a rideshare protocol thereby making point-to-point travel possible. This will be achieved by having a large number of aircraft manufactured, making use of cheaper fuels to run the aircraft and creating autonomy in the process via the protocol.\n\nToday, aircraft manufacturing companies have trade secrets and the process of building the systems used to operate their aircraft is accessed by only a few people in the world. Arrow has come to change this by making it open for anyone to join and provide expertise in making this a reality. By building in public, Arrow has demystified the building process and has attracted a large community of builders who are working tirelessly to birth this vision while getting rewarded for it. It is in fact why Arrow’s business logic sits on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone who connects with what Arrow is building can join the organization without any interviews or hiring process, contribute their skills to the progress of the project, and get compensated for work done easily.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the entire engineering team will be managed virtually and this is made possible by the advancements in software technology where physical prototypes are no longer the only ways to test for progress but CAD models can be built and tested via CFD testing. Robotic factories and contracted manufacturers can then build out the solution from just anywhere. There are three major committees that make up Arrow, they include:\n\n* Engineering Team\n* Growth and Operations Team\n* Services Team\n\nEach of these committees has distinct functions and they also work cross-functionally to get work done. The engineering team is responsible for developing the hardware and software on which Arrow will operate while the growth and operations team manages the processes involved in running the DAO while creating avenues to communicate about the DAO to the public and getting more qualified people onboard the project. Finally, The services team handles the development of the software backend infrastructure.",

          "shortTitle": "Contributors",
          "details": "Contributors at Arrow DAO are people with various expertise coming together to work, not as employees but as independent contractors. This enables them to work at their own time, from wherever they are, and get rewarded for work done. So, they do not need to commit a fixed amount of time to Arrow DAO but can choose how they want to operate. \n\nThere are two ways that contributors at Arrow are structured. These structures are expertise and commitment levels. It is clear that as a DAO, people with varying skill sets and experience levels will join to contribute to the DAO. It is important to have a way of differentiating people based on the level of expertise they have shown in that skill area and also give tasks based on that. On the flip side, expertise is not all there is when assigning tasks to contributors. A simple way to different contributors is based on the amount of time they are willing to commit to the growth of the DAO. So, if a contributor is willing to work as much as 30 hours a week, then this will also determine how work will be assigned to the person. \n\n**Expertise Level**\n\nThe perceived expected value that a contributor adds to the DAO determines the expertise level that is associated with that contributor. On applying to the DAO, every contributor is assigned a particular level based on the experience, skill, knowledge, and talent of the contributor. The concept applied here is not fixed but can be fluid for specific situations as the levels are more of guides for contributors to assess themselves and others and not exactly a definition of positions or ranking. Below, are the various expertise levels as described by Arrow DAO.\n\n**Level 1: Beginning Expertise**\n* Contributor is new to VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in general.\n* Contributor has some experience in field of interest or subject-matter expertise.\n* Contributor has just started to know about Arrow.\n**Level 2: Emerging Expertise**\n* Contributor has some experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in general.\n* Contributor has moderate experience in field of interest or subject-matter expertise.\n* Contributor has a little knowledge of Arrow.\n**Level 3: Solid Expertise**\n* Contributor is experienced in VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in general.\n* Contributor has some years of experience in field of interest or subject-matter expertise.\n* Contributor is quite knowledgeable about Arrow\n* Contributor shows promise but needs some refinement and practice\n**Level 4: High Expertise**\n* Contributor has great experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in general.\n* Contributor has many years of experience in field of interest or subject-matter expertise.\n* Contributor is very knowledgeable about Arrow\n* Contributor is very talented\n**Level 5: Very High Expertise**\n* Contributor has very great experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in general.\n* Contributor is a recognized leader in field of interest or subject-matter expertise.\n* Contributor is extremely knowledgeable about Arrow\n* Contributor is highly talented.\n\n**Commitment Level**\n\nWhen contributors join a DAO, one of the things that are looked out for is how committed the contributor will be to the vision. However, there is no clear definition as to what commitment is in a DAO, hence, it is flexible and is subject to specific cases. In Arrow DAO, some of the ways to measure commitment are by the amount of time, focus, dedication, effort, and prioritization among others that a contributor gives to Arrow. Some of the structures in place for measuring commitment levels in Arrow DAO are as follows\n\n**100% (aka “Full Commitment”)**\n* Contributor works full time which is a minimum of 35 hours on a weekly basis\n* Contributor considers Arrow as top priority\n* Arrow is the main focal point for the contributor as they may have one or two side projects within the ecosystem\n* Contributor goes over and beyond to see that Arrow succeeds\n**Level: 90%**\n* Contributor works a maximum of approximately 35 hours on a weekly basis\n* Contributor considers Arrow as top priority\n* Arrow is the main focal point for the contributor but they also have other commitments.\n* Contributor is willing to go over and beyond to see that Arrow succeeds\n**Level: 75%**\n* Contributor works for approximately 28 hours on a weekly basis.\n* Contributor considers Arros as the main priority\n* Arrow is one of some of the commitments the contributor has\n* The focus of the contributor is split across projects\n**Level: 50%**\n* Contributor works for approximately 20 hours on a weekly basis\n* Contributor sees Arrow as a meaningful priority\n* Arrow is one of some of the commitments the contributor has\n* The focus of the contributor is split across projects\n**Level: 25%**\n* Contributor works for about 10 - 15 hours on a weekly basis\n* Contributor considers Arrow as the main priority relative to other commitments\n* Arrow is one of many of the commitments the contributor has\n* The focus of the contributor is split across projects\n**Level: 15%**\n* Contributor works for about 5 - 10 hours on a weekly basis\n* Contributor considers Arrow as 2nd, 3rd, or 4th priority\n* The focus of the contributor is split across projects",

          "shortTitle": "Compensation",
          "details": "Contributors at Arrow DAO earn rewards for participating in the development of the DAO and its vision. There are three main channels of compensation for work done in the DAO which are categorized as follows:\n\n1. Base\n2. Bonus\n3. Ownership\n\n**Base**\n\nThese are the core rewards received by contributors in Arrow DAO after they have given their time and skills to complete tasks in the DAO. There are two tracks for the base compensation and they are commitment compensation and retroactive compensation tracks. Contributors can choose what tracks they prefer to work with which will reflect in the way they are paid for a given period. The following explains how they differ and what contributors get as rewards from each of them.\n\n* **Commitment Compensation Track**\n\nThe commitment compensation track is a balance of the commitment level of the contributor and the expected value that a contributor brings to the DAO managed every two (2) months. So, the number of hours committed and the expertise level of the contributor is used to measure the compensation of the contributor for that 2-month period. The payment is made in both USDC and ARROW tokens with payments made at the end of every month. The amount paid monthly for a full-time contributor with an expertise level of 5 is $12,000 and other levels are a percentage of this value.

They are either bounties posted by committees or funding proposals designed by contributors.\n\n* Bounties: A bounty is a task that is developed by a committee or sub-committee for contributors to apply to. It usually comes with a brief containing the timeframe it should take to complete the task, the expectations of the task, the requirements for the task, and the payment value upon completion. The bounties are posted on Dework and when the task has been completed, the sub-committee for that bounty reviews the work done and after all the requirements have been met, then a payment is made to the contributor also via Dework. If the work done is not satisfactory based on the assessment of the sub-committee, then the work is reassigned to another contributor.\n* Funding Proposals: This a case where a contributor writes a proposal to the DAO to request funding in order to complete a task within a 1 or 2-month period. This proposal may be a result of a gap observed or a problem to be solved in the DAO. When the proposal is received, the sub-committee that it addresses reviews it and takes a decision on whether to approve, amend or reject it. If it is approved, then a task is created on Dework with the associated cost as well as other requirements and is assigned to the contributor that came up with the funding proposal or to someone else as agreed by both the sub-committee and the contributor. Based on the agreement, payment is made upon the final review of the work or before the implementation of the work on the funding proposal.\n\n**Bonus**\n\nThe bonus payment is a way to gift tokens to contributors who are working hard for the DAO as seen by other contributors. So, Arrow creates an environment where contributors can gift other contributors tokens based on perceived performance. How this is done is that every month, a pool of ARROW tokens is funded and contributors get 1,000 ARROW each from where they can decide who they want to gift among the team of contributors that are in the DAO based on the great work they have seen them accomplish for the DAO. Arrow DAO can also decide to gift some contributors who have been immensely valuable extra ARROW tokens if they deem it fit. \n\nAt the end of the Corrinape epoch, the tokens are distributed based on the gifting outcomes of all contributors put together. If a contributor is considered undervalued, however, Arrow DAO can further compensate the contributor by distributing more ARROW tokens to the contributor.\n\n**Ownership**\n\nArrow DAO has created a system for its contributors to own ARROW tokens (the governance token of the DAO) and is using it as a way to foster long-term thinking in the DAO. The tokens earned are to vest for a period of three (3) years with a one (1) year cliff. This means that a contributor must stay at least one year for about 33% of the tokens earned to be theirs in real terms. If the contributor stays through the three (3) years, then the tokens earned for that period would have vested and the full amount of tokens earned will be theirs in real terms as well. If the contributor doesn’t stay for up to one (1) year, then no token is given to the contributor.\n\nMost payments made in Arrow DAO are a combination of USDC and ARROW. The condition for this is that a contributor must earn at least 10% of ARROW for every payment but not more than 50% ARROW while the balance is paid in USDC.",

          "details": "Arrow DAO has a number of tools that it uses to compensate contributors for work done. This is because Arrow DAO operates a multi-faceted compensation system that involves making payments in USDC and ARROW tokens used for governance, as well as ARROW tokens gifted by other contributors. The following explains how Arrow DAO is using these tools.\n\n* [LlamaPay](https://llamapay.io/): This is a tool used by Arrow DAO to make real-time payments to contributors in the commitment compensation track. At the beginning of the 2-month period that the track lasts before reassessing, USDC is sent continuously until the period ends so that contributors can have access to their funds at any point in time. However, first-time contributors on this track, they’ll be able to access their USDC in the first 2-month period via [Sablier](https://app.sablier.finance/).\n* [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/arrow-air): This is used for task management and payouts for contributors working in the retroactive compensation track when bounties are assigned or funding proposals approved by sub-committees in Arrow DAO.\n* [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/): Arrow DAO uses Coordinape to distribute ARROW tokens to contributors via a circle that allows other contributors to gift other contributors. It is also via Coordinape that the DAO rewards outstanding contributors when they decide to do so.",

The following process outlines how contributors can begin their journey with Arrow DAO.\n\n1. Join the [Arrow Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fab4bxaAW9) channel and get verified\n2. Fill out the [registration form](https://forms.gle/BAJ4DpijHA9PDtH76) for contributors\n3. Decide on the track to follow as a contributor\n4. For the commitment compensation track, at the beginning of a 2-month cycle, a self-assessment form will be provided where the contributor will fill in their expertise level, commitment level in hours per week, select the percentage of ARROW tokens to be received relative to USDC, identify the circles they will like to contribute to, and sign-off on Arrow DAO’s mission and values.\n5. For the retroactive compensation track, every month, the sub-committees determined by budget availability and work needs come up with bounties that contributors on this track can take up.",
