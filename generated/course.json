          "details": "Bankless DAO is focused on onboarding 1 Billion people to web3. It does this by building the media rails required for people to learn about the crypto space. By leveraging the power of community, Bankless DAO is solving the problem of coordination, creating wealth for many people, and making it easy for people to understand what web3 is and how to be a part of it. Through developing written and audio media content, building DAO tooling platforms, providing consultancy to other communities, and giving scholarships to people interested in learning web3, Bankless DAO is creating the channels for increasing crypto adoption across the world.\n\nBankless DAO is built on three core values; Education, Culture, and Decentralized Governance. Learning is at the heart of adoption in the web3 space. So, educating one another with accurate information irrespective of the media of communication is integral to what Bankless DAO is building. So far, articles, podcasts, videos, and forum discussions are some of the ways people in the community learn to educate one another on DeFi, DAOs, and web3 in general. Also, Bankless DAO is building a culture of self-organizing systems where the community comes up with new initiatives that drive the growth of the DAO. It is a culture that rewards action-takers and encourages risks. This is because, without risks, there is no reward. Finally, decision-making is not done by a select few but by the collective by implementing decentralized governance where every token holder in the community has a say in the decisions taken in the DAO.\n\nA number of projects have been executed by the community to foster growth and build relationships in the DAO. Some of the projects include:\n\n* [Bankless Consulting](https://www.banklessconsulting.com/): A service that connects over 15,000 web3 talents to professional services in various work areas such as tech, marketing, finance, legal, and management.\n\n* [Degen Project](https://bankless.notion.site/DEGEN-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8): A discord bot that carries out administrative functions across Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Podcast Hatchery](https://bankless.notion.site/Podcast-Hatchery-0c2676175267445180c8f5cb3d3f14bb): A podcast that empowers creators to start their own podcast, improve their production skills, and grow an audio-based audience as they share knowledge on web3 thereby living out the vision of Bankless DAO.\n\n* [Bankless Loans](https://bankless.notion.site/Bankless-Loans-c6b90fad24b24312b184840e49694f7f): This is a DeFi application that provides loans as a way for the DAO to generate revenue for its treasury.\n\n* [Bankless Academy](https://app.banklessacademy.com/): This is an application that teaches people with little or no knowledge of crypto to become competent crypto users.\n\nThere are more projects in Bankless DAO and they all contribute to achieving the mission of onboarding 1 Billion people to the web3 space.\n\nFinally, Bankless DAO has a governance token (BANK) which it uses to vote on decisions made in the DAO. Holders of the token are community members and they collaborate to see that Bankless continues to grow and is positioned to be a massive success.",

          "details": "[Guilds](https://www.bankless.community/about-us/guilds) are the structures for contribution in Bankless DAO. This is how contributors are clustered based on skills, areas of interest, and professional backgrounds to achieve a common goal. In each guild, contributors work with one another to incubate ideas and also perform cross-functional activities to provide support where necessary DAO-wide. There are various guilds in Bankless DAO, namely:\n\n* Analytics Guild\n* Audiovisual Guild\n* DAOlationships Guild\n* Design Guild\n* Developers Guild\n* Education Guild\n* Legal Guild\n* Marketing Guild\n* Operations Guild\n* Research Guild\n* Treasury Guild\n* Translators Guild\n* Writers Guild\n\nThe analytics guild uses data to provide insights and build data-based products for the DAO. The audiovisual guild creates audio and video content for the DAO, and the DAOlationships guild builds partnerships with other organizations and communities. \n\nThe design guild creates designs for the DAO, the developers guild builds tools and provides developer education, and the education guild provides educational materials on web3 and related topics. \n\nThe legal guild handles legal issues and education on legal structures for web3 organizations, the marketing guild uses marketing initiatives to promote the DAO, and the operations guild handles day-to-day administrative tasks. \n\nThe research guild conducts research and documentation, the treasury guild manages the financial resources of the DAO, the translators guild publicizes the DAO's work in different languages, and the writers guild handles writing projects for the DAO. All of these guilds work together to sustainably develop the DAO and achieve its goals.\n",

          "key": "how-are-contributors-compensated",
          "shortTitle": "Compensation",
          "details": "Bankless DAO as other DAOs has contributors working in various guilds to ensure the sustainable growth of the DAO. When these contributors give their time and skills to the DAO, they are rewarded for work done and time spent working on different projects. A common situation for DAOs is thinking about the right way to compensate contributors in a fair manner especially when they are many. For Bankless DAO, the tool used for coordinating compensation is known as [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/).\n\nOn Coordinape, the compensation is done by community members and not the core team. This is so that, other contributors who have seen the impact of their fellow contributors decide who gets compensated. It solves the problem of bias as you only get rewarded if you collaborate with others and they can clearly see that you have done some work. This process of gifting one another tokens based on contributions is done via Gift Circles and what is either given or received is known as GIVE. The GIVE token is the native token used by Coordinape to vote for one another and to be able to either give or receive, a person must be a part of the circle.\n\nThere are three types of contributors that can be rewarded in Bankless DAO using Coordinape; L1 members, L2 members, and guest pass holders. L1 members are those who own at least 35,000 BANK or an equivalent of LP tokens from certified AMMs. L2 members are contributors that have been nominated and voted into leadership roles due to their level of dedication and hardwork in the DAO while guest pass holders are contributors that are active in the DAO but do not have enough BANK tokens. \n\nL1 and L2 members can either give or receive GIVE depending on the circle they are in. However, guest pass holders can only receive. At the end of every epoch (the period it takes for gifting to occur), the GIVE tokens that have been shared by the contributors will be converted into a BANK token which is the native token for Bankless DAO and is sent to all contributorsâ€™ wallets. The conversion from GIVE to BANK tokens is dependent on the number of BANK tokens in supply. If there are 1,000 BANK tokens open for supply and a contributor gets  1,000 GIVE tokens out of 10,000 GIVE tokens, then 1,000 GIVE becomes 10% of the total tokens available. 10% multiplied by 1,000 BANK tokens equals 100 BANK tokens.",

          "shortTitle": "Tool: Coordinape",
          "details": "Coordinape being the central compensation platform on Bankless DAO is used to distribute tokens on a monthly basis. The process for distribution is known as a Coordinape round which is a monthly period where GIVE tokens are allocated to contributors. Each round goes through four stages before it is completed.\n\n1. Submission: Every member of the DAO submits a form with relevant information such as their Discord ID,  wallet address, membership type, and other necessary information requested by the DAO.\n2. Upload to Coordinape: Upon submission by active contributors for the month, the admin takes the information submitted and uploads it to their respective Coordinape circles.\n3. Allocation Period: After the upload is completed, contributors will now be able to choose other contributors to gift as a way of compensating them for work done in that month.\n4. Payout: At the end of the round the grants committee will allocate BANK tokens to contributors based on the number of GIVE received in that round.\n\nThere are two rounds through which Bankless DAO uses Coordinape to distribute compensation in form of rounds. These rounds are highlighted below:\n\n* Bankless DAO Coordinape Round\n* Guild/Project Coordinape Round\n\n**Bankless DAO Coordinape Round**\n\nThis is a monthly round that occurs across the DAO to compensate contributors for that month. In this round, contributors are placed in the L1, L2, or Guest Pass Circle.\n\nFor L1 circle, L1 members can both give and receive from other contributors, L2 can only give and guest pass cannot be on this circle. For L2 circle, L1 members can only give, L2 members can both give and receive while guest pass cannot join this circle. Finally, for the guest pass circle, both L1 and L2 members can only give while guest pass members can only receive. \n\n* L1 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L1 can receive\n* L2 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L2 can receive\n* Guest Pass Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only Guest Pass can receive\n\nFor clarity, the table below highlights the different circles and their responsibilities.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td>L1 Circle\n   </td>\n   <td>L2 Circle\n   </td>\n   <td>Guest Pass Circle\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>L1 Members\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give and Receive\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>L2 Members\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give and Receive\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Give Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Guest Pass Holders\n   </td>\n   <td>Not Allowed\n   </td>\n   <td>Not Allowed\n   </td>\n   <td>Can Receive Only\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nWhen organizing the round, the primary coordinator handles the process and there are certain steps that are required.\n\n1. A calendar is set up months ahead with dates for each round. A sample is shown below:\n\n![alt_text](images/image1.jpg \"image_tooltip\")\n\n2. Set up three Google forms for L1, L2, and guest pass circles. \n3. Ensure Degen is synced with the forms by going to the #degen-general channel on Discord and asking the team to load up the three forms for distribution.\n4. Submit the form links to the Degen team\n5. Test the form in #bot-commands channel on Discord to confirm that the automation is live before the submission period begins.\n6. Announce the submission period on Discord, Community Calls and Weekly Newsletters continuously for at least one week before the date.\n7. Open the links for submissions while still announcing.\n8. Hand over the data 1 - 2 days before submission ends so that the team can give Coordnipae ample time to bulk upload the data from the forms.\n9. Announce allocation period to community members once uploading is completed. \n10. Once the allocation period is completed, the CSV file is exported and the GIVE values are converted to BANK before being loaded to Gnosis and the details of the transactions posted on Discord.\n11. The Grants Committee then approves the multisig for payment in 1 - 2 days.\n\n**Guild/Project Coordinape Round**\n\nThe guild/project Coordinape round is specific to each guild. It could be at the end of every month or at the end of a season (three month period within which focused work is done). For this round, only those who are a part of the guild running the round can join the circle. Usually, leaders of these guilds add contributors to guild circles and at any time contributors allocate GIVE to fellow contributors, routine tasks are carried out by the community to ensure that only active contributors get rewarded for work done.\n\nFor the round to take place, the following steps need to be taken for the smooth allocation of tokens to contributors.\n\n1. Set up a Google Form or a Tally depending on the guild\n2. Get members to sign up on the forms and submit information such as Discord handle and wallet address. They can also provide information about whether they have been actively contributing and what they have done within the period\n3. Go to Coordinape and create the epoch (the round) by clicking on â€˜Create Epochâ€™ (This is assuming you are an admin and the circle has been set up before now).\n\n![alt_text](images/image2.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n4. Set the duration and the start date of the epoch (allocation period).\n5. Upon creation of the epoch, confirm that the members listed are the same as those on the submission form.\n6. If a contributor changes their wallet address, then use the â€˜actionâ€™ button to edit the details or even remove members from the list.\n\n![alt_text](images/image3.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n7. You can as well add contributors by clicking on the â€˜Add Contributorâ€™ button and inputting the access level of the contributor.\n\n![alt_text](images/image4.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n8. Once the process is complete, announce on Discord at several times and wait for the epoch to begin.\n9. At the end of the allocation period, click on the â€˜Export CSVâ€™ button and calculate the number of BANK to be received based on the number of GIVE tokens owned by each contributor.\n\n![alt_text](images/image5.png \"image_tooltip\")",
