 ## DIA DAO
 
 **What is DIA DAO?**        
[DIA (Decentralized Information Asset)](https://www.diadata.org/) is a multi-chain oracle that connects decentralized applications to multiple data sources. It receives data from multiple sources on various Blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, etc., stores the data in one location and provides the data to other solutions (DApps) that need them. So, rather than trying to connect to multiple sources directly which could be expensive to manage and difficult to build, DApps can connect to DIA and have access to these data based on what is needed. The interesting thing to note is that DIA has made this process very simple that if you need token prices, chart data, or other use cases as part of the features of your application, then you can simply generate them from DIA.

[DIA DAO](https://dao.diadata.org/) is a decentralized organization that builds and manages DIA. It is decentralized in that there is a community of people who work together without any central leadership that takes decisions on their behalf. In fact, the community itself takes decisions on behalf of the DAO via governance processes such as voting on proposals. The DAO is focused on three main goals as it moves towards becoming a fully decentralized organization. They are:

* Product/Platform Development
* Community Ownership and Governance
* Awareness and Engagement

The essence of these three goals is to allow the DAO to provide its core proposition to its users by constantly working on the product and expanding the features to increase the utility of the platform while creating an environment for ownership in the community. So, people can own tokens in the DAO, invest their time to structure the DAO properly, and ultimately guide the DAO to success. Finally, the community can join hands in getting people to know about the DAO and its products which should drive traction and encourage more people to join the DAO.

DIA DAO provides incentives to anyone who joins the DAO and seeks to use their time and skills to advance the project such as earning rewards in Ethereum (ETH) for work done, Experience Points (XP) for special rewards, and DIA tokens as well. These layers of rewards have been put in place to encourage contributors to work hard in ensuring that the goals highlighted above are met and success is achieved. Divided into guilds, members of the DAO can work with other people with similar skills in one or more guilds depending on the level of skills possessed by the contributor and apart from the obvious rewards, other incentives for joining are getting a reputation in the web3 economy, connecting and networking with peers, being on the frontline of the future of work, learning and developing new skills, co-creating the data layer of the web3 economy, and shaping the future of DIA DAO. 
 **How are members structured in DIA DAO?**        
**Guilds**

DIA DAO has made it possible for contributors to collaborate with one another to get work done. The coordination of work is made possible by guilds which are small units where people are put together based on skills/functional areas. In DIA DAO, there are six (6) guilds, and they are listed below:

* Design
* Growth & Promo
* Copywriting
* Business Development
* Operations
* Tech

These guilds have their unique purposes and based on their names, it is clear what each of them is for. The design guild is tasked with creating unique visual assets such as graphics and videos across the DAO to enable clear communication both within and outside the DAO. The Growth & Promo guild works to promote the DAO on various channels while creating a system that will foster the growth of the DAO. The copywriting guild is the content bank of the DAO. They develop great written content in form of articles, blog posts, copies, books, etc. that communicates what the DAO is doing per time and also educational content to teach people about multi-chain oracles and web3 in general. The business development guild handles the adoption of the products/services provided by DIA by identifying users while the operations guild manages onboarding processes, evaluating work, and distributing rewards. Finally, the tech guild builds the core products of the DAO.

**Roles**

As the DAO is divided into guilds, so are the roles in the DAO and irrespective of the guild a contributor is in, the roles must be within the three categories available. The three roles for contributors in DIA DAO include:

* DAO Contributor
* DAO Ambassador
* DAO Leader

The role occupied by a member of the DAO is dependent on the level they are in the DAO. As an approved contributor, you are automatically a DAO Contributor and that tag will be given in Discord as well. They handle all types of tasks in the DAO as they form the majority of contributors in the DAO. DAO Ambassadors are one step ahead and they carry out specific functions such as hosting events across the world, running local communities, and other responsibilities as they come. Finally, DAO Leaders serve as managers in different capacities. They are native to the DAO and understand what DIA is trying to achieve in the long run. They also shape the direction of the DAO, take up duties, manage processes, coordinate work, and facilitate growth in the DAO. 
 **How are Contributors Compensated?**        
Contributors join DAOs so they can give their time and skills to the growth of the DAO and in return get rewarded for doing that. In DIA DAO, this is the case as people get rewards after completing tasks assigned to them to work on. The tool for managing tasks and getting rewarded on DIA DAO is Dework. With Dework, DIA DAO is able to develop tasks, assign them, get them evaluated and reward the contributor for work done. This clear process for managing contributors from onboarding to compensation in DIA DAO is discussed below.

**Onboarding**

People interested in joining the DAO will have to sign up by joining Discord and following the process below:

1. Verify yourself in the **[#üìåÔΩúverify](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)** channel by following the prompt.

2. Get to the  **[#üåêÔΩúinfo-center](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)** channel.

3. Apply to become a contributor by clicking on this [link](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Application) and follow the instructions on the page. Once the application is reviewed and approved, the role **#DAO-Applicant** is assigned.

4. As a **#DAO-Applicant**, it is time to prove yourself. To do this, [choose the guild](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Guilds) that you are willing to join and complete their onboarding task. An example is the onboarding task for the copywriting guild which is to write a blog post on ‚ÄúWhat is DIA?‚Äù. Take a look at the task [here](https://app.dework.xyz/dia-dao/copywriting-guild-l4nawag6?taskId=f87d63ab-1095-40e5-abf5-f7f7b6c8a731).

5. Upon completion of the task, if the guild leader finds your work interesting, you‚Äôll be added to the guild and be given the **#DAO-Contributor **role and be added to the guild on Discord.

**Complete Tasks**

The next step as a **#DAO-Contributor** is to be active in the community and be on the lookout for tasks. Periodically, the guild leader will post bounties for everyone in the guild to apply to. The following process is followed for every task in DIA DAO.

1. A bounty is posted by the leader of the guild on Dework and Discord
2. Members apply to the bounty by following the instructions stated
3. Once at least 3 contributors apply to the bounty, it is then assigned to one or more of the contributors depending on what is needed
4. When the work is complete, the task is evaluated

**Compensation**

After a task has been completed, evaluated, and approved, then the contributor who did the work is due for compensation. The rewards for contribution are usually in ETH and XP. While ETH is the direct monetary reward, XP is also given for every task as a way to increase boosters for contributors and even give them access to better tasks in the future as it increases. XP can also be exchanged for DIA tokens. 

There are other rewards for tasks such as DIA tokens for some special tasks that will be impactful to the DAO in the long run. Also, NFT badges are rewards that are earned by the contributors for completing tasks. An example is the NFT badge that is received when a contributor completes the onboarding task. 
 **How is DIA DAO using Dework?**        
Dework is a web3 native tool for managing projects end to end. It facilitates collaboration among teams, tracks work progress, and makes token payments easy to achieve. In this process, DAOs can have a workflow for their contributors from the beginning of a task to when they receive rewards for work done. So, based on the structure of DIA DAO, Dework is the tool of choice for managing various processes that involve contributors in the DAO. There are a number of ways that DIA DAO is making use of Dework to make coordination simple and efficient and they are highlighted below:

* Role Management
* Leaderboard
* Task Management
* Combined Board

**Role Management**

On DIA DAO, while there are generalized roles (such as DAO Applicant, DAO Contributor, DAO Ambassador, and DAO Leader), there are specific roles associated with the different guilds that a contributor is a part of. An example of this is; In the copywriting guild, the role of a contributor is known as **#DAO-Copywriter**. So, depending on the number of roles a contributor has, DIA DAO makes it clear to everyone the roles that they are in and what they have access to. In making this very explicit, DIA DAO has a board on Dework that shows the contributor the available roles and what roles the contributor has. 

To see the roles on Dework, open DIA DAO on Dework and click on roles (this assumed that you are now a contributor on Dework).

![alt_text](images/image1.jpg "image_tooltip")

From the image above, you‚Äôll see the roles the contributor has access to greyed out while the roles yet to be received are active. With this, every contributor has a clear view of what they can work on based on the roles they hold.

**Leaderboard**

DIA DAO has a leaderboard as a way to rank contributors for work done in the DAO. The ranking is a result of the accumulated XP (experience points) a contributor earns. The way it works is that for every bounty completed by a contributor, there is a stipulated Dollar reward paid in ETH and XP. So, while the contributor gets the ETH, the XP is used to rank the contributor in the DAO. These points earned can give the contributor access to more work as trust has been earned and the cycle continues. The calculation for how much XP should be earned for a given task is explained in the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Dollar Value
   </td>
   <td>XP Multiple
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$0 - $100
   </td>
   <td>10x Dollar Value
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$101 - $200
   </td>
   <td>5x Dollar Value
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$201+
   </td>
   <td>1x Dollar Value
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

An example of this is if there are two bounties, the first has a reward of $150 and the second $600, the XP earned will be 1250 XP (($100 x 10) + ($50 x 5)) for the first and 1900 XP (($100 x 10) + ($100 x 5) + ($400 x 1)) for the second one.

There are two types of leaderboards (weekly and monthly) and they have rewards for those who make it to the top of the boards. The weekly leaderboard runs from Friday 10 AM - Friday 9:59 AM and the reward (paid in XP via Dework) is stated below:

* 1st: 500 XP
* 2nd: 300 XP
* 3rd: 200 XP

A sample of the weekly board as seen on Dework is shown below:

![alt_text](images/image2.jpg "image_tooltip")

The monthly leaderboard runs from the first day of the month to the last day of the month and the reward (paid in ETH via Dework) is stated below:

* 1st: 100$
* 2nd: 50$
* 3rd: 30$
* 4th: 20$
* 5th: 10$

The image below shows an example of the leaderboard on Dework

![alt_text](images/image3.jpg "image_tooltip")

**Task Management**

Tasks in DIA DAO are structured in form of bounties which are work to be completed by the community by selecting the person(s) to work on it after vetting submitted proposals by contributors. The process for this is provided below

1. The leader of a guild publishes the bounty with the reward associated with it on Dework and Discord and clear instructions on what the proposal should look like and the expectations from completing the bounty will be stated. 

![alt_text](images/image4.jpg "image_tooltip")

2. With this information, contributors will submit their proposals on Dework as well and the best is chosen to work on the bounty. 
3. After the work is completed, the payment is made to the contributor via Dework.

**Combined Board**

The combined board shows all the bounties across the DAO that are in the backlog, in progress, and done. Every contributor can have a good view of what is on the board and also what has been assigned. The image below shows the combined Board of DIA DAO on Dework.
