    Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are decentralized networks
    that are run by a set of rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain.
    In order for DAOs to maintain the network, they require contributors. These
    contributors typically provide resources to help the DAO operate and
    function properly. They also provide the required skills needed to perform
    various functions within the DAO such as developing products, managing
    communities, onboarding users, and building the brand. Additionally, they
    may also participate in decision-making processes within the DAO, helping to
    shape its direction and determine how it should operate. Without
    contributors, a DAO would not be able to function effectively, as it would
    lack the necessary resources and input from its members. This

    shows some things both DAOs and contributors can do to ease the process of
    contributing to the DAO.


    As DAOs grow, there is usually an increase in the number of contributors to
    the DAO. These contributors get to set how they want to work and the length
    of time they want to give to the DAO. DAOs also measure the work done by
    contributors so they can track progress and reward them accordingly.
    However, there could be some challenges with tracking the quality of work
    done by contributors. Sometimes, even though a DAO may have a large number
    of contributors, there may be little work done if people are not clear on
    what they are to work on or even understand what is happening in the DAO at
    the time.


    Also, contributors want to be rewarded for work done in the DAO. This means
    giving them some form of payment for tasks, projects, or bounties completed.
    The conversations about rewarding contributors are evolving just as DAOs
    are. DAOs need to consider what type of work should be rewarded, the value
    of the reward that is fair, the rewards structures that are in place, and so
    on. This guide explains some approaches to take in measuring contributions
    in DAOs to ensure that contributors are rewarded efficiently.


    ### **Measuring Contributions in DAOs**


    When people join DAOs, they do so with the intention of contributing to the
    DAO and getting rewarded afterward. However, there are many cases where
    people join DAO communities on Discord and feel left out mostly because
    there is a high amount of engagement on different things going on in the DAO
    and not enough clear path for people to know how to contribute. 


    To efficiently measure contributions, there are a number of things to have
    in place. They include:


    * Create a simple procedure to onboard contributors

    * Enabling environment for contributors

    * Define the work structure

    * Setting a clear KPI


    **Onboarding Contributors**


    Many DAOs do not have a defined process for onboarding contributors other
    than just joining Discord so this makes it really difficult for people to
    blend in with the community. Many people do not go through the pain of
    figuring things out by themselves so they join the community and do not do
    anything meaningful. Creating a system for contributors to follow in order
    to contribute to the DAO gives the DAO access to quality contributors who
    know exactly how they want to contribute.


    **Enabling Environment for Contributors**


    This is key for every DAO since the environment created determines the level
    of energy contributors will bring when functioning within the DAO. People
    should be able to ask questions about processes and products and be sure to
    get answers. Today, DAOs are constantly in need of contributors because
    contributors get tired easily and many times, stop working. So, in addition
    to the flexibility that DAOs bring naturally, a good environment will help
    the DAO get quality and helpful contributions that will rank high when
    measured.


    **Work Structure**


    Since DAOs are flexible, contributors can decide when and what to work on
    depending on the availability of tasks or functions. However, a good
    structure of both core contributors and other contributors can help the DAO
    achieve its goals. If the DAO has only part-time contributors who work at
    their own convenience, then the majority of the work that needs to be done
    may never get done since there is no one to primarily hold responsible for
    those duties. Also, if there are only core contributors, then the idea of
    decentralization in DAOs will be defeated. So, a balance of both is
    necessary for growth in the DAO.


    **Setting KPIs**


    Once a contributor goes through the process and is confirmed, the next thing
    to ensure that the contributions are measured well is to set clear Key
    Performance Indicators (KPIs) for different functions or skill areas.
    Contributors should know what the KPIs are and should be dedicated to
    achieving them. When contributors turn in their work, the community can
    decide on the quality of work done based on the KPI set for it. This way,
    every work is measured against a KPI or a north star metric and people are
    encouraged to do their best work.


    ### **Reward Structure**


    Determining the rewards for contributions made in a DAO can be tricky.
    Oftentimes, DAOs want to ensure that people who are compensated actually do
    great work for the DAO and contributors want to feel adequately rewarded for
    work done. To get a good understanding of the different reward structures,
    including their pros and cons, read this
    [article](https://gasless.substack.com/p/understanding-dao-incentives-and).


    Some of the structures for rewarding contributors in DAOs include:


    * Funding Proposals

    * Collective Rewards

    * Token rewards

    * Grants

    * Bounties


    **Funding Proposals**


    Contributors can request funds as rewards for work done over a given period
    of time from the DAO. For this, it is expected that the work would have been
    approved to be done with a number of KPIs stated to determine the completion
    of the work. Also, an associated amount should have been approved for the
    work to be done. Hence, once the work is done, the contributor can then put
    up a proposal to receive the funds stipulated for the task(s).


    **Collective Rewards**


    Rewards are kept aside for contributors based on how valuable their work is
    to other contributors. If it is found to be highly valuable, then a
    predetermined amount is given to the contributor. This is to encourage
    people to put their best foot forward when carrying out a task in the DAO. 


    **Token Rewards**


    As contributors put their skills forward to develop a DAO, a way to reward
    them is to make them have a sense of ownership by rewarding them with DAO
    tokens. When contributors are rewarded this way, they are given the power to
    easily vote on decisions made in the DAO. So, aside from doing great work,
    they can create proposals and even influence the direction of the DAO
    through their votes.


    **Grants**


    There are cases where complex projects may be needed in a DAO or other DAOs
    may want to build on the progress of a bigger DAO by leveraging their
    technology to create new experiences. The DAO can set up a grant program to
    which people can apply to fund those complex projects. Many times, these
    projects are external and other times are led by contributors of the DAO.


    **Bounties**


    These are rewards for specific tasks with well-defined completion criteria
    that DAOs open up for the public to work on. The work is usually associated
    with a fixed reward and anyone who completes the task gets the reward.
