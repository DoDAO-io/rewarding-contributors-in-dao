  title: What is Arrow?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    [Arrow](https://www.arrowair.com/) is a web3 native open-source community
    that is focused on the future of air mobility by building the infrastructure
    required for anyone to be able to move from one point to another on earth.
    The goal is to build vertical takeoff aircraft that are affordable and can
    be accessed by anyone via a rideshare protocol thereby making point-to-point
    travel possible. This will be achieved by having a large number of aircraft
    manufactured, making use of cheaper fuels to run the aircraft and creating
    autonomy in the process via the protocol.


    Today, aircraft manufacturing companies have trade secrets and the process
    of building the systems used to operate their aircraft is accessed by only a
    few people in the world. Arrow has come to change this by making it open for
    anyone to join and provide expertise in making this a reality. By building
    in public, Arrow has demystified the building process and has attracted a
    large community of builders who are working tirelessly to birth this vision
    while getting rewarded for it. It is in fact why Arrow’s business logic sits
    on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone who connects with what Arrow is
    building can join the organization without any interviews or hiring process,
    contribute their skills to the progress of the project, and get compensated
    for work done easily.


    It is interesting to note that the entire engineering team will be managed
    virtually and this is made possible by the advancements in software
    technology where physical prototypes are no longer the only ways to test for
    progress but CAD models can be built and tested via CFD testing. Robotic
    factories and contracted manufacturers can then build out the solution from
    just anywhere. There are three major committees that make up Arrow, they
    include:


    * Engineering Team

    * Growth and Operations Team

    * Services Team


    Each of these committees has distinct functions and they also work
    cross-functionally to get work done. The engineering team is responsible for
    developing the hardware and software on which Arrow will operate while the
    growth and operations team manages the processes involved in running the DAO
    while creating avenues to communicate about the DAO to the public and
    getting more qualified people onboard the project. Finally, The services
    team handles the development of the software backend infrastructure.

  shortTitle: Contributors
  details: >-
    Contributors at Arrow DAO are people with various expertise coming together
    to work, not as employees but as independent contractors. This enables them
    to work at their own time, from wherever they are, and get rewarded for work
    done. So, they do not need to commit a fixed amount of time to Arrow DAO but
    can choose how they want to operate. 


    There are two ways that contributors at Arrow are structured. These
    structures are expertise and commitment levels. It is clear that as a DAO,
    people with varying skill sets and experience levels will join to contribute
    to the DAO. It is important to have a way of differentiating people based on
    the level of expertise they have shown in that skill area and also give
    tasks based on that. On the flip side, expertise is not all there is when
    assigning tasks to contributors. A simple way to different contributors is
    based on the amount of time they are willing to commit to the growth of the
    DAO. So, if a contributor is willing to work as much as 30 hours a week,
    then this will also determine how work will be assigned to the person. 


    **Expertise Level**


    The perceived expected value that a contributor adds to the DAO determines
    the expertise level that is associated with that contributor. On applying to
    the DAO, every contributor is assigned a particular level based on the
    experience, skill, knowledge, and talent of the contributor. The concept
    applied here is not fixed but can be fluid for specific situations as the
    levels are more of guides for contributors to assess themselves and others
    and not exactly a definition of positions or ranking. Below, are the various
    expertise levels as described by Arrow DAO.


    * **Level 1: Beginning Expertise**

    * Contributor is new to VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in
    general.

    * Contributor has some experience in field of interest or subject-matter
    expertise.

    * Contributor has just started to know about Arrow.

    * **Level 2: Emerging Expertise**

    * Contributor has some experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and
    web3 in general.

    * Contributor has moderate experience in field of interest or subject-matter
    expertise.

    * Contributor has a little knowledge of Arrow.

    * **Level 3: Solid Expertise**

    * Contributor is experienced in VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in
    general.

    * Contributor has some years of experience in field of interest or
    subject-matter expertise.

    * Contributor is quite knowledgeable about Arrow

    * Contributor shows promise but needs some refinement and practice

    * **Level 4: High Expertise**

    * Contributor has great experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and
    web3 in general.

    * Contributor has many years of experience in field of interest or
    subject-matter expertise.

    * Contributor is very knowledgeable about Arrow

    * Contributor is very talented

    * **Level 5: Very High Expertise**

    * Contributor has very great experience with VTOL, engineering, design,
    DAOs, and web3 in general.

    * Contributor is a recognized leader in field of interest or subject-matter
    expertise.

    * Contributor is extremely knowledgeable about Arrow

    * Contributor is highly talented.


    **Commitment Level**


    When contributors join a DAO, one of the things that are looked out for is
    how committed the contributor will be to the vision. However, there is no
    clear definition as to what commitment is in a DAO, hence, it is flexible
    and is subject to specific cases. In Arrow DAO, some of the ways to measure
    commitment are by the amount of time, focus, dedication, effort, and
    prioritization among others that a contributor gives to Arrow. Some of the
    structures in place for measuring commitment levels in Arrow DAO are as
    follows


    * **100% (aka “Full Commitment”)**

    * Contributor works full time which is a minimum of 35 hours on a weekly
    basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as top priority

    * Arrow is the main focal point for the contributor as they may have one or
    two side projects within the ecosystem

    * Contributor goes over and beyond to see that Arrow succeeds

    * **Level: 90%**

    * Contributor works a maximum of approximately 35 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as top priority

    * Arrow is the main focal point for the contributor but they also have other
    commitments.

    * Contributor is willing to go over and beyond to see that Arrow succeeds

    * **Level: 75%**

    * Contributor works for approximately 28 hours on a weekly basis.

    * Contributor considers Arros as the main priority

    * Arrow is one of some of the commitments the contributor has

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

    * **Level: 50%**

    * Contributor works for approximately 20 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor sees Arrow as a meaningful priority

    * Arrow is one of some of the commitments the contributor has

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

    * **Level: 25%**

    * Contributor works for about 10 - 15 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as the main priority relative to other
    commitments

    * Arrow is one of many of the commitments the contributor has

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

    * **Level: 15%**

    * Contributor works for about 5 - 10 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as 2nd, 3rd, or 4th priority

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects
