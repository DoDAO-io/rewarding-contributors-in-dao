  title: What is Arrow?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    [Arrow](https://www.arrowair.com/) is a web3 native open-source community
    that is focused on the future of air mobility by building the infrastructure
    required for anyone to be able to move from one point to another on earth.
    The goal is to build vertical takeoff aircraft that are affordable and can
    be accessed by anyone via a rideshare protocol thereby making point-to-point
    travel possible. This will be achieved by having a large number of aircraft
    manufactured, making use of cheaper fuels to run the aircraft and creating
    autonomy in the process via the protocol.


    Today, aircraft manufacturing companies have trade secrets and the process
    of building the systems used to operate their aircraft is accessed by only a
    few people in the world. Arrow has come to change this by making it open for
    anyone to join and provide expertise in making this a reality. By building
    in public, Arrow has demystified the building process and has attracted a
    large community of builders who are working tirelessly to birth this vision
    while getting rewarded for it. It is in fact why Arrow’s business logic sits
    on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone who connects with what Arrow is
    building can join the organization without any interviews or hiring process,
    contribute their skills to the progress of the project, and get compensated
    for work done easily.


    It is interesting to note that the entire engineering team will be managed
    virtually and this is made possible by the advancements in software
    technology where physical prototypes are no longer the only ways to test for
    progress but CAD models can be built and tested via CFD testing. Robotic
    factories and contracted manufacturers can then build out the solution from
    just anywhere. There are three major committees that make up Arrow, they
    include:


    * Engineering Team

    * Growth and Operations Team

    * Services Team


    Each of these committees has distinct functions and they also work
    cross-functionally to get work done. The engineering team is responsible for
    developing the hardware and software on which Arrow will operate while the
    growth and operations team manages the processes involved in running the DAO
    while creating avenues to communicate about the DAO to the public and
    getting more qualified people onboard the project. Finally, The services
    team handles the development of the software backend infrastructure.

  title: Measurement structure for Contributors
  shortTitle: Contributors
  details: >-
    Contributors at Arrow DAO are people with various expertise coming together
    to work, not as employees but as independent contractors. This enables them
    to work at their own time, from wherever they are, and get rewarded for work
    done. So, they do not need to commit a fixed amount of time to Arrow DAO but
    can choose how they want to operate. 


    There are two ways that contributors at Arrow are structured. These
    structures are expertise and commitment levels. It is clear that as a DAO,
    people with varying skill sets and experience levels will join to contribute
    to the DAO. It is important to have a way of differentiating people based on
    the level of expertise they have shown in that skill area and also give
    tasks based on that. On the flip side, expertise is not all there is when
    assigning tasks to contributors. A simple way to different contributors is
    based on the amount of time they are willing to commit to the growth of the
    DAO. So, if a contributor is willing to work as much as 30 hours a week,
    then this will also determine how work will be assigned to the person. 


    **Expertise Level**


    The perceived expected value that a contributor adds to the DAO determines
    the expertise level that is associated with that contributor. On applying to
    the DAO, every contributor is assigned a particular level based on the
    experience, skill, knowledge, and talent of the contributor. The concept
    applied here is not fixed but can be fluid for specific situations as the
    levels are more of guides for contributors to assess themselves and others
    and not exactly a definition of positions or ranking. Below, are the various
    expertise levels as described by Arrow DAO.


    **Level 1: Beginning Expertise**

    * Contributor is new to VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in
    general.

    * Contributor has some experience in field of interest or subject-matter
    expertise.

    * Contributor has just started to know about Arrow.

    **Level 2: Emerging Expertise**

    * Contributor has some experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and
    web3 in general.

    * Contributor has moderate experience in field of interest or subject-matter
    expertise.

    * Contributor has a little knowledge of Arrow.

    **Level 3: Solid Expertise**

    * Contributor is experienced in VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and web3 in
    general.

    * Contributor has some years of experience in field of interest or
    subject-matter expertise.

    * Contributor is quite knowledgeable about Arrow

    * Contributor shows promise but needs some refinement and practice

    **Level 4: High Expertise**

    * Contributor has great experience with VTOL, engineering, design, DAOs, and
    web3 in general.

    * Contributor has many years of experience in field of interest or
    subject-matter expertise.

    * Contributor is very knowledgeable about Arrow

    * Contributor is very talented

    **Level 5: Very High Expertise**

    * Contributor has very great experience with VTOL, engineering, design,
    DAOs, and web3 in general.

    * Contributor is a recognized leader in field of interest or subject-matter
    expertise.

    * Contributor is extremely knowledgeable about Arrow

    * Contributor is highly talented.


    **Commitment Level**


    When contributors join a DAO, one of the things that are looked out for is
    how committed the contributor will be to the vision. However, there is no
    clear definition as to what commitment is in a DAO, hence, it is flexible
    and is subject to specific cases. In Arrow DAO, some of the ways to measure
    commitment are by the amount of time, focus, dedication, effort, and
    prioritization among others that a contributor gives to Arrow. Some of the
    structures in place for measuring commitment levels in Arrow DAO are as
    follows


    **100% (aka “Full Commitment”)**

    * Contributor works full time which is a minimum of 35 hours on a weekly
    basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as top priority

    * Arrow is the main focal point for the contributor as they may have one or
    two side projects within the ecosystem

    * Contributor goes over and beyond to see that Arrow succeeds

    **Level: 90%**

    * Contributor works a maximum of approximately 35 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as top priority

    * Arrow is the main focal point for the contributor but they also have other
    commitments.

    * Contributor is willing to go over and beyond to see that Arrow succeeds

    **Level: 75%**

    * Contributor works for approximately 28 hours on a weekly basis.

    * Contributor considers Arros as the main priority

    * Arrow is one of some of the commitments the contributor has

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

    **Level: 50%**

    * Contributor works for approximately 20 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor sees Arrow as a meaningful priority

    * Arrow is one of some of the commitments the contributor has

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

    **Level: 25%**

    * Contributor works for about 10 - 15 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as the main priority relative to other
    commitments

    * Arrow is one of many of the commitments the contributor has

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

    **Level: 15%**

    * Contributor works for about 5 - 10 hours on a weekly basis

    * Contributor considers Arrow as 2nd, 3rd, or 4th priority

    * The focus of the contributor is split across projects

  title: How are contributors compensated?
  shortTitle: Compensation
  details: >-
    Contributors at Arrow DAO earn rewards for participating in the development
    of the DAO and its vision. There are three main channels of compensation for
    work done in the DAO which are categorized as follows:


    1. Base

    2. Bonus

    3. Ownership


    **Base**


    These are the core rewards received by contributors in Arrow DAO after they
    have given their time and skills to complete tasks in the DAO. There are two
    tracks for the base compensation and they are commitment compensation and
    retroactive compensation tracks. Contributors can choose what tracks they
    prefer to work with which will reflect in the way they are paid for a given
    period. The following explains how they differ and what contributors get as
    rewards from each of them.


    * **Commitment Compensation Track**


    The commitment compensation track is a balance of the commitment level of
    the contributor and the expected value that a contributor brings to the DAO
    managed every two (2) months. So, the number of hours committed and the
    expertise level of the contributor is used to measure the compensation of
    the contributor for that 2-month period. The payment is made in both USDC
    and ARROW tokens with payments made at the end of every month. The amount
    paid monthly for a full-time contributor with an expertise level of 5 is
    $12,000 and other levels are a percentage of this value. This matrix table
    below gives an example of the commitment compensation track across expertise
    and commitment levels.

       </td>
       <td>$4,000
       </td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    * **Retroactive Compensation Track**


    This compensation method is much more flexible as it is based on tasks
    completed by contributors. They are either bounties posted by committees or
    funding proposals designed by contributors.


    * Bounties: A bounty is a task that is developed by a committee or
    sub-committee for contributors to apply to. It usually comes with a brief
    containing the timeframe it should take to complete the task, the
    expectations of the task, the requirements for the task, and the payment
    value upon completion. The bounties are posted on Dework and when the task
    has been completed, the sub-committee for that bounty reviews the work done
    and after all the requirements have been met, then a payment is made to the
    contributor also via Dework. If the work done is not satisfactory based on
    the assessment of the sub-committee, then the work is reassigned to another
    contributor.

    * Funding Proposals: This a case where a contributor writes a proposal to
    the DAO to request funding in order to complete a task within a 1 or 2-month
    period. This proposal may be a result of a gap observed or a problem to be
    solved in the DAO. When the proposal is received, the sub-committee that it
    addresses reviews it and takes a decision on whether to approve, amend or
    reject it. If it is approved, then a task is created on Dework with the
    associated cost as well as other requirements and is assigned to the
    contributor that came up with the funding proposal or to someone else as
    agreed by both the sub-committee and the contributor. Based on the
    agreement, payment is made upon the final review of the work or before the
    implementation of the work on the funding proposal.


    **Bonus**


    The bonus payment is a way to gift tokens to contributors who are working
    hard for the DAO as seen by other contributors. So, Arrow creates an
    environment where contributors can gift other contributors tokens based on
    perceived performance. How this is done is that every month, a pool of ARROW
    tokens is funded and contributors get 1,000 ARROW each from where they can
    decide who they want to gift among the team of contributors that are in the
    DAO based on the great work they have seen them accomplish for the DAO.
    Arrow DAO can also decide to gift some contributors who have been immensely
    valuable extra ARROW tokens if they deem it fit. 


    At the end of the Corrinape epoch, the tokens are distributed based on the
    gifting outcomes of all contributors put together. If a contributor is
    considered undervalued, however, Arrow DAO can further compensate the
    contributor by distributing more ARROW tokens to the contributor.


    **Ownership**


    Arrow DAO has created a system for its contributors to own ARROW tokens (the
    governance token of the DAO) and is using it as a way to foster long-term
    thinking in the DAO. The tokens earned are to vest for a period of three (3)
    years with a one (1) year cliff. This means that a contributor must stay at
    least one year for about 33% of the tokens earned to be theirs in real
    terms. If the contributor stays through the three (3) years, then the tokens
    earned for that period would have vested and the full amount of tokens
    earned will be theirs in real terms as well. If the contributor doesn’t stay
    for up to one (1) year, then no token is given to the contributor.


    Most payments made in Arrow DAO are a combination of USDC and ARROW. The
    condition for this is that a contributor must earn at least 10% of ARROW for
    every payment but not more than 50% ARROW while the balance is paid in USDC.
- key: tools-for-managing-payouts-in-arrow-dao
  shortTitle: Tools
  details: >-
    Arrow DAO has a number of tools that it uses to compensate contributors for
    work done. This is because Arrow DAO operates a multi-faceted compensation
    system that involves making payments in USDC and ARROW tokens used for
    governance, as well as ARROW tokens gifted by other contributors. The
    following explains how Arrow DAO is using these tools.


    * [LlamaPay](https://llamapay.io/): This is a tool used by Arrow DAO to make
    real-time payments to contributors in the commitment compensation track. At
    the beginning of the 2-month period that the track lasts before reassessing,
    USDC is sent continuously until the period ends so that contributors can
    have access to their funds at any point in time. However, first-time
    contributors on this track, they’ll be able to access their USDC in the
    first 2-month period via [Sablier](https://app.sablier.finance/).

    * [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/arrow-air): This is used for task
    management and payouts for contributors working in the retroactive
    compensation track when bounties are assigned or funding proposals approved
    by sub-committees in Arrow DAO.

    * [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/): Arrow DAO uses Coordinape to
    distribute ARROW tokens to contributors via a circle that allows other
    contributors to gift other contributors. It is also via Coordinape that the
    DAO rewards outstanding contributors when they decide to do so.
  title: Tools for managing payouts in Arrow DAO
- key: how-to-get-started-on-arrow-dao
  shortTitle: Get Started
  details: >-
    Every contributor that joins Arrow DAO will have to decide what track to be
    a part of and that will determine the flow of work over time. The following
    process outlines how contributors can begin their journey with Arrow DAO.


    1. Join the [Arrow Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fab4bxaAW9) channel
    and get verified

    2. Fill out the [registration form](https://forms.gle/BAJ4DpijHA9PDtH76) for
    contributors

    3. Decide on the track to follow as a contributor

    4. For the commitment compensation track, at the beginning of a 2-month
    cycle, a self-assessment form will be provided where the contributor will
    fill in their expertise level, commitment level in hours per week, select
    the percentage of ARROW tokens to be received relative to USDC, identify the
    circles they will like to contribute to, and sign-off on Arrow DAO’s mission
    and values.

    5. For the retroactive compensation track, every month, the sub-committees
    determined by budget availability and work needs come up with bounties that
    contributors on this track can take up.
