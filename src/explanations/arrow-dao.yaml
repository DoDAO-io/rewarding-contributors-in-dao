  title: What is Arrow?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    [Arrow](https://www.arrowair.com/) is a web3 native open-source community
    that is focused on the future of air mobility by building the infrastructure
    required for anyone to be able to move from one point to another on earth.
    The goal is to build vertical takeoff aircraft that are affordable and can
    be accessed by anyone via a rideshare protocol thereby making point-to-point
    travel possible. This will be achieved by having a large number of aircraft
    manufactured, making use of cheaper fuels to run the aircraft and creating
    autonomy in the process via the protocol.


    Today, aircraft manufacturing companies have trade secrets and the process
    of building the systems used to operate their aircraft is accessed by only a
    few people in the world. Arrow has come to change this by making it open for
    anyone to join and provide expertise in making this a reality. By building
    in public, Arrow has demystified the building process and has attracted a
    large community of builders who are working tirelessly to birth this vision
    while getting rewarded for it. It is in fact why Arrowâ€™s business logic sits
    on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone who connects with what Arrow is
    building can join the organization without any interviews or hiring process,
    contribute their skills to the progress of the project, and get compensated
    for work done easily.


    It is interesting to note that the entire engineering team will be managed
    virtually and this is made possible by the advancements in software
    technology where physical prototypes are no longer the only ways to test for
    progress but CAD models can be built and tested via CFD testing. Robotic
    factories and contracted manufacturers can then build out the solution from
    just anywhere. There are three major committees that make up Arrow, they
    include:


    * Engineering Team

    * Growth and Operations Team

    * Services Team


    Each of these committees has distinct functions and they also work
    cross-functionally to get work done. The engineering team is responsible for
    developing the hardware and software on which Arrow will operate while the
    growth and operations team manages the processes involved in running the DAO
    while creating avenues to communicate about the DAO to the public and
    getting more qualified people onboard the project. Finally, The services
    team handles the development of the software backend infrastructure.
