  title: What is DIA DAO?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    [DIA (Decentralized Information Asset)](https://www.diadata.org/) is a
    multi-chain oracle that connects decentralized applications to multiple data
    sources. It receives data from multiple sources on various Blockchain
    networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, etc., stores
    the data in one location and provides the data to other solutions (DApps)
    that need them. So, rather than trying to connect to multiple sources
    directly which could be expensive to manage and difficult to build, DApps
    can connect to DIA and have access to these data based on what is needed.
    The interesting thing to note is that DIA has made this process very simple
    that if you need token prices, chart data, or other use cases as part of the
    features of your application, then you can simply generate them from DIA.


    [DIA DAO](https://dao.diadata.org/) is a decentralized organization that
    builds and manages DIA. It is decentralized in that there is a community of
    people who work together without any central leadership that takes decisions
    on their behalf. In fact, the community itself takes decisions on behalf of
    the DAO via governance processes such as voting on proposals. The DAO is
    focused on three main goals as it moves towards becoming a fully
    decentralized organization. They are:


    * Product/Platform Development

    * Community Ownership and Governance

    * Awareness and Engagement


    The essence of these three goals is to allow the DAO to provide its core
    proposition to its users by constantly working on the product and expanding
    the features to increase the utility of the platform while creating an
    environment for ownership in the community. So, people can own tokens in the
    DAO, invest their time to structure the DAO properly, and ultimately guide
    the DAO to success. Finally, the community can join hands in getting people
    to know about the DAO and its products which should drive traction and
    encourage more people to join the DAO.


    DIA DAO provides incentives to anyone who joins the DAO and seeks to use
    their time and skills to advance the project such as earning rewards in
    Ethereum (ETH) for work done, Experience Points (XP) for special rewards,
    and DIA tokens as well. These layers of rewards have been put in place to
    encourage contributors to work hard in ensuring that the goals highlighted
    above are met and success is achieved. Divided into guilds, members of the
    DAO can work with other people with similar skills in one or more guilds
    depending on the level of skills possessed by the contributor and apart from
    the obvious rewards, other incentives for joining are getting a reputation
    in the web3 economy, connecting and networking with peers, being on the
    frontline of the future of work, learning and developing new skills,
    co-creating the data layer of the web3 economy, and shaping the future of
    DIA DAO.
