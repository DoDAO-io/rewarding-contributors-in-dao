  title: What is DIA DAO?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    [DIA (Decentralized Information Asset)](https://www.diadata.org/) is a
    multi-chain oracle that connects decentralized applications to multiple data
    sources. It receives data from multiple sources on various Blockchain
    networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, Polygon, etc., stores
    the data in one location and provides the data to other solutions (DApps)
    that need them. So, rather than trying to connect to multiple sources
    directly which could be expensive to manage and difficult to build, DApps
    can connect to DIA and have access to these data based on what is needed.
    The interesting thing to note is that DIA has made this process very simple
    that if you need token prices, chart data, or other use cases as part of the
    features of your application, then you can simply generate them from DIA.


    [DIA DAO](https://dao.diadata.org/) is a decentralized organization that
    builds and manages DIA. It is decentralized in that there is a community of
    people who work together without any central leadership that takes decisions
    on their behalf. In fact, the community itself takes decisions on behalf of
    the DAO via governance processes such as voting on proposals. The DAO is
    focused on three main goals as it moves towards becoming a fully
    decentralized organization. They are:


    * Product/Platform Development

    * Community Ownership and Governance

    * Awareness and Engagement


    The essence of these three goals is to allow the DAO to provide its core
    proposition to its users by constantly working on the product and expanding
    the features to increase the utility of the platform while creating an
    environment for ownership in the community. So, people can own tokens in the
    DAO, invest their time to structure the DAO properly, and ultimately guide
    the DAO to success. Finally, the community can join hands in getting people
    to know about the DAO and its products which should drive traction and
    encourage more people to join the DAO.


    DIA DAO provides incentives to anyone who joins the DAO and seeks to use
    their time and skills to advance the project such as earning rewards in
    Ethereum (ETH) for work done, Experience Points (XP) for special rewards,
    and DIA tokens as well. These layers of rewards have been put in place to
    encourage contributors to work hard in ensuring that the goals highlighted
    above are met and success is achieved. Divided into guilds, members of the
    DAO can work with other people with similar skills in one or more guilds
    depending on the level of skills possessed by the contributor and apart from
    the obvious rewards, other incentives for joining are getting a reputation
    in the web3 economy, connecting and networking with peers, being on the
    frontline of the future of work, learning and developing new skills,
    co-creating the data layer of the web3 economy, and shaping the future of
    DIA DAO.

  shortTitle: Guilds and Roles
  details: >-
    **Guilds**

    DIA DAO has made it possible for contributors to collaborate with one
    another to get work done. The coordination of work is made possible by
    guilds which are small units where people are put together based on
    skills/functional areas. In DIA DAO, there are six (6) guilds, and they are
    listed below:


    * Design

    * Growth & Promo

    * Copywriting

    * Business Development

    * Operations

    * Tech


    These guilds have their unique purposes and based on their names, it is
    clear what each of them is for. The design guild is tasked with creating
    unique visual assets such as graphics and videos across the DAO to enable
    clear communication both within and outside the DAO. The Growth & Promo
    guild works to promote the DAO on various channels while creating a system
    that will foster the growth of the DAO. The copywriting guild is the content
    bank of the DAO. They develop great written content in form of articles,
    blog posts, copies, books, etc. that communicates what the DAO is doing per
    time and also educational content to teach people about multi-chain oracles
    and web3 in general. The business development guild handles the adoption of
    the products/services provided by DIA by identifying users while the
    operations guild manages onboarding processes, evaluating work, and
    distributing rewards. Finally, the tech guild builds the core products of
    the DAO.


    **Roles**

    As the DAO is divided into guilds, so are the roles in the DAO and
    irrespective of the guild a contributor is in, the roles must be within the
    three categories available. The three roles for contributors in DIA DAO
    include:


    * DAO Contributor

    * DAO Ambassador

    * DAO Leader


    The role occupied by a member of the DAO is dependent on the level they are
    in the DAO. As an approved contributor, you are automatically a DAO
    Contributor and that tag will be given in Discord as well. They handle all
    types of tasks in the DAO as they form the majority of contributors in the
    DAO. DAO Ambassadors are one step ahead and they carry out specific
    functions such as hosting events across the world, running local
    communities, and other responsibilities as they come. Finally, DAO Leaders
    serve as managers in different capacities. They are native to the DAO and
    understand what DIA is trying to achieve in the long run. They also shape
    the direction of the DAO, take up duties, manage processes, coordinate work,
    and facilitate growth in the DAO.

  shortTitle: Compensation
  details: >-
    Contributors join DAOs so they can give their time and skills to the growth
    of the DAO and in return get rewarded for doing that. In DIA DAO, this is
    the case as people get rewards after completing tasks assigned to them to
    work on. The tool for managing tasks and getting rewarded on DIA DAO is
    Dework. With Dework, DIA DAO is able to develop tasks, assign them, get them
    evaluated and reward the contributor for work done. This clear process for
    managing contributors from onboarding to compensation in DIA DAO is
    discussed below.


    **Onboarding**

    People interested in joining the DAO will have to sign up by joining Discord
    and following the process below:


    1. Verify yourself in the
    **[#üìåÔΩúverify](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)**
    channel by following the prompt.


    2. Get to the 
    **[#üåêÔΩúinfo-center](https://discord.com/channels/772395240677179402/772395241500049420/1061273555137986612)**
    channel.


    3. Apply to become a contributor by clicking on this
    [link](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Application) and follow the instructions
    on the page. Once the application is reviewed and approved, the role
    **#DAO-Applicant** is assigned.


    4. As a **#DAO-Applicant**, it is time to prove yourself. To do this,
    [choose the guild](https://go.diadata.org/DAO-Guilds) that you are willing
    to join and complete their onboarding task. An example is the onboarding
    task for the copywriting guild which is to write a blog post on ‚ÄúWhat is
    DIA?‚Äù. Take a look at the task
    [here](https://app.dework.xyz/dia-dao/copywriting-guild-l4nawag6?taskId=f87d63ab-1095-40e5-abf5-f7f7b6c8a731).


    5. Upon completion of the task, if the guild leader finds your work
    interesting, you‚Äôll be added to the guild and be given the
    **#DAO-Contributor **role and be added to the guild on Discord.


    **Complete Tasks**

    The next step as a **#DAO-Contributor** is to be active in the community and
    be on the lookout for tasks. Periodically, the guild leader will post
    bounties for everyone in the guild to apply to. The following process is
    followed for every task in DIA DAO.


    1. A bounty is posted by the leader of the guild on Dework and Discord

    2. Members apply to the bounty by following the instructions stated

    3. Once at least 3 contributors apply to the bounty, it is then assigned to
    one or more of the contributors depending on what is needed

    4. When the work is complete, the task is evaluated


    **Compensation**

    After a task has been completed, evaluated, and approved, then the
    contributor who did the work is due for compensation. The rewards for
    contribution are usually in ETH and XP. While ETH is the direct monetary
    reward, XP is also given for every task as a way to increase boosters for
    contributors and even give them access to better tasks in the future as it
    increases. XP can also be exchanged for DIA tokens. 


    There are other rewards for tasks such as DIA tokens for some special tasks
    that will be impactful to the DAO in the long run. Also, NFT badges are
    rewards that are earned by the contributors for completing tasks. An example
    is the NFT badge that is received when a contributor completes the
    onboarding task.
