  title: What is Bankless DAO?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    Bankless DAO is focused on onboarding 1 Billion people to web3. It does this
    by building the media rails required for people to learn about the crypto
    space. By leveraging the power of community, Bankless DAO is solving the
    problem of coordination, creating wealth for many people, and making it easy
    for people to understand what web3 is and how to be a part of it. Through
    developing written and audio media content, building DAO tooling platforms,
    providing consultancy to other communities, and giving scholarships to
    people interested in learning web3, Bankless DAO is creating the channels
    for increasing crypto adoption across the world.


    Bankless DAO is built on three core values; Education, Culture, and
    Decentralized Governance. Learning is at the heart of adoption in the web3
    space. So, educating one another with accurate information irrespective of
    the media of communication is integral to what Bankless DAO is building. So
    far, articles, podcasts, videos, and forum discussions are some of the ways
    people in the community learn to educate one another on DeFi, DAOs, and web3
    in general. Also, Bankless DAO is building a culture of self-organizing
    systems where the community comes up with new initiatives that drive the
    growth of the DAO. It is a culture that rewards action-takers and encourages
    risks. This is because, without risks, there is no reward. Finally,
    decision-making is not done by a select few but by the collective by
    implementing decentralized governance where every token holder in the
    community has a say in the decisions taken in the DAO.


    A number of projects have been executed by the community to foster growth
    and build relationships in the DAO. Some of the projects include:


    * [Bankless Consulting](https://www.banklessconsulting.com/): A service that
    connects over 15,000 web3 talents to professional services in various work
    areas such as tech, marketing, finance, legal, and management.


    * [Degen
    Project](https://bankless.notion.site/DEGEN-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8):
    A discord bot that carries out administrative functions across Bankless DAO.


    * [Podcast
    Hatchery](https://bankless.notion.site/Podcast-Hatchery-0c2676175267445180c8f5cb3d3f14bb):
    A podcast that empowers creators to start their own podcast, improve their
    production skills, and grow an audio-based audience as they share knowledge
    on web3 thereby living out the vision of Bankless DAO.


    * [Bankless
    Loans](https://bankless.notion.site/Bankless-Loans-c6b90fad24b24312b184840e49694f7f):
    This is a DeFi application that provides loans as a way for the DAO to
    generate revenue for its treasury.


    * [Bankless Academy](https://app.banklessacademy.com/): This is an
    application that teaches people with little or no knowledge of crypto to
    become competent crypto users.


    There are more projects in Bankless DAO and they all contribute to achieving
    the mission of onboarding 1 Billion people to the web3 space.


    Finally, Bankless DAO has a governance token (BANK) which it uses to vote on
    decisions made in the DAO. Holders of the token are community members and
    they collaborate to see that Bankless continues to grow and is positioned to
    be a massive success.
- key: what-are-guilds
  shortTitle: Guilds
  details: >
    [Guilds](https://www.bankless.community/about-us/guilds) are the structures
    for contribution in Bankless DAO. This is how contributors are clustered
    based on skills, areas of interest, and professional backgrounds to achieve
    a common goal. In each guild, contributors work with one another to incubate
    ideas and also perform cross-functional activities to provide support where
    necessary DAO-wide. There are various guilds in Bankless DAO, namely:


    * Analytics Guild

    * Audiovisual Guild

    * DAOlationships Guild

    * Design Guild

    * Developers Guild

    * Education Guild

    * Legal Guild

    * Marketing Guild

    * Operations Guild

    * Research Guild

    * Treasury Guild

    * Translators Guild

    * Writers Guild


    The analytics guild uses data to provide insights and build data-based
    products for the DAO. The audiovisual guild creates audio and video content
    for the DAO, and the DAOlationships guild builds partnerships with other
    organizations and communities. 


    The design guild creates designs for the DAO, the developers guild builds
    tools and provides developer education, and the education guild provides
    educational materials on web3 and related topics. 


    The legal guild handles legal issues and education on legal structures for
    web3 organizations, the marketing guild uses marketing initiatives to
    promote the DAO, and the operations guild handles day-to-day administrative
    tasks. 


    The research guild conducts research and documentation, the treasury guild
    manages the financial resources of the DAO, the translators guild publicizes
    the DAO's work in different languages, and the writers guild handles writing
    projects for the DAO. All of these guilds work together to sustainably
    develop the DAO and achieve its goals.
  title: What are Guilds?
- key: how-are-contributors-compensated
  shortTitle: Compensation
  details: >-
    Bankless DAO as other DAOs has contributors working in various guilds to
    ensure the sustainable growth of the DAO. When these contributors give their
    time and skills to the DAO, they are rewarded for work done and time spent
    working on different projects. A common situation for DAOs is thinking about
    the right way to compensate contributors in a fair manner especially when
    they are many. For Bankless DAO, the tool used for coordinating compensation
    is known as [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/).


    On Coordinape, the compensation is done by community members and not the
    core team. This is so that, other contributors who have seen the impact of
    their fellow contributors decide who gets compensated. It solves the problem
    of bias as you only get rewarded if you collaborate with others and they can
    clearly see that you have done some work. This process of gifting one
    another tokens based on contributions is done via Gift Circles and what is
    either given or received is known as GIVE. The GIVE token is the native
    token used by Coordinape to vote for one another and to be able to either
    give or receive, a person must be a part of the circle.


    There are three types of contributors that can be rewarded in Bankless DAO
    using Coordinape; L1 members, L2 members, and guest pass holders. L1 members
    are those who own at least 35,000 BANK or an equivalent of LP tokens from
    certified AMMs. L2 members are contributors that have been nominated and
    voted into leadership roles due to their level of dedication and hardwork in
    the DAO while guest pass holders are contributors that are active in the DAO
    but do not have enough BANK tokens. 


    L1 and L2 members can either give or receive GIVE depending on the circle
    they are in. However, guest pass holders can only receive. At the end of
    every epoch (the period it takes for gifting to occur), the GIVE tokens that
    have been shared by the contributors will be converted into a BANK token
    which is the native token for Bankless DAO and is sent to all contributorsâ€™
    wallets. The conversion from GIVE to BANK tokens is dependent on the number
    of BANK tokens in supply. If there are 1,000 BANK tokens open for supply and
    a contributor gets  1,000 GIVE tokens out of 10,000 GIVE tokens, then 1,000
    GIVE becomes 10% of the total tokens available. 10% multiplied by 1,000 BANK
    tokens equals 100 BANK tokens.
  title: How are Contributors Compensated?
- key: how-is-bankless-dao-using-coordinape
  shortTitle: 'Tool: Coordinape'
  details: >-
    Coordinape being the central compensation platform on Bankless DAO is used
    to distribute tokens on a monthly basis. The process for distribution is
    known as a Coordinape round which is a monthly period where GIVE tokens are
    allocated to contributors. Each round goes through four stages before it is
    completed.


    1. Submission: Every member of the DAO submits a form with relevant
    information such as their Discord ID,  wallet address, membership type, and
    other necessary information requested by the DAO.

    2. Upload to Coordinape: Upon submission by active contributors for the
    month, the admin takes the information submitted and uploads it to their
    respective Coordinape circles.

    3. Allocation Period: After the upload is completed, contributors will now
    be able to choose other contributors to gift as a way of compensating them
    for work done in that month.

    4. Payout: At the end of the round the grants committee will allocate BANK
    tokens to contributors based on the number of GIVE received in that round.


    There are two rounds through which Bankless DAO uses Coordinape to
    distribute compensation in form of rounds. These rounds are highlighted
    below:


    * Bankless DAO Coordinape Round

    * Guild/Project Coordinape Round


    **Bankless DAO Coordinape Round**


    This is a monthly round that occurs across the DAO to compensate
    contributors for that month. In this round, contributors are placed in the
    L1, L2, or Guest Pass Circle.


    For L1 circle, L1 members can both give and receive from other contributors,
    L2 can only give and guest pass cannot be on this circle. For L2 circle, L1
    members can only give, L2 members can both give and receive while guest pass
    cannot join this circle. Finally, for the guest pass circle, both L1 and L2
    members can only give while guest pass members can only receive. 


    * L1 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L1 can receive

    * L2 Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only L2 can receive

    * Guest Pass Circle - L1 and L2 can give, but only Guest Pass can receive


    For clarity, the table below highlights the different circles and their
    responsibilities.


    <table>
      <tr>
       <td>
       </td>
       <td>L1 Circle
       </td>
       <td>L2 Circle

       <td>Can Receive Only
       </td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    When organizing the round, the primary coordinator handles the process and
    there are certain steps that are required.


    1. A calendar is set up months ahead with dates for each round. A sample is
    shown below:


    ![alt_text](images/image1.jpg "image_tooltip")


    2. Set up three Google forms for L1, L2, and guest pass circles. 

    3. Ensure Degen is synced with the forms by going to the #degen-general
    channel on Discord and asking the team to load up the three forms for
    distribution.

    4. Submit the form links to the Degen team

    5. Test the form in #bot-commands channel on Discord to confirm that the
    automation is live before the submission period begins.

    6. Announce the submission period on Discord, Community Calls and Weekly
    Newsletters continuously for at least one week before the date.

    7. Open the links for submissions while still announcing.

    8. Hand over the data 1 - 2 days before submission ends so that the team can
    give Coordnipae ample time to bulk upload the data from the forms.

    9. Announce allocation period to community members once uploading is
    completed. 

    10. Once the allocation period is completed, the CSV file is exported and
    the GIVE values are converted to BANK before being loaded to Gnosis and the
    details of the transactions posted on Discord.

    11. The Grants Committee then approves the multisig for payment in 1 - 2
    days.


    **Guild/Project Coordinape Round**


    The guild/project Coordinape round is specific to each guild. It could be at
    the end of every month or at the end of a season (three month period within
    which focused work is done). For this round, only those who are a part of
    the guild running the round can join the circle. Usually, leaders of these
    guilds add contributors to guild circles and at any time contributors
    allocate GIVE to fellow contributors, routine tasks are carried out by the
    community to ensure that only active contributors get rewarded for work
    done.


    For the round to take place, the following steps need to be taken for the
    smooth allocation of tokens to contributors.


    1. Set up a Google Form or a Tally depending on the guild

    2. Get members to sign up on the forms and submit information such as
    Discord handle and wallet address. They can also provide information about
    whether they have been actively contributing and what they have done within
    the period

    3. Go to Coordinape and create the epoch (the round) by clicking on â€˜Create
    Epochâ€™ (This is assuming you are an admin and the circle has been set up
    before now).


    ![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


    4. Set the duration and the start date of the epoch (allocation period).

    5. Upon creation of the epoch, confirm that the members listed are the same
    as those on the submission form.

    6. If a contributor changes their wallet address, then use the â€˜actionâ€™
    button to edit the details or even remove members from the list.


    ![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


    7. You can as well add contributors by clicking on the â€˜Add Contributorâ€™
    button and inputting the access level of the contributor.


    ![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


    8. Once the process is complete, announce on Discord at several times and
    wait for the epoch to begin.

    9. At the end of the allocation period, click on the â€˜Export CSVâ€™ button and
    calculate the number of BANK to be received based on the number of GIVE
    tokens owned by each contributor.
