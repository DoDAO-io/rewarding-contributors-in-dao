  title: What is Bankless DAO?
  shortTitle: Background
  details: >-
    Bankless DAO is focused on onboarding 1 Billion people to web3. It does this
    by building the media rails required for people to learn about the crypto
    space. By leveraging the power of community, Bankless DAO is solving the
    problem of coordination, creating wealth for many people, and making it easy
    for people to understand what web3 is and how to be a part of it. Through
    developing written and audio media content, building DAO tooling platforms,
    providing consultancy to other communities, and giving scholarships to
    people interested in learning web3, Bankless DAO is creating the channels
    for increasing crypto adoption across the world.


    Bankless DAO is built on three core values; Education, Culture, and
    Decentralized Governance. Learning is at the heart of adoption in the web3
    space. So, educating one another with accurate information irrespective of
    the media of communication is integral to what Bankless DAO is building. So
    far, articles, podcasts, videos, and forum discussions are some of the ways
    people in the community learn to educate one another on DeFi, DAOs, and web3
    in general. Also, Bankless DAO is building a culture of self-organizing
    systems where the community comes up with new initiatives that drive the
    growth of the DAO. It is a culture that rewards action-takers and encourages
    risks. This is because, without risks, there is no reward. Finally,
    decision-making is not done by a select few but by the collective by
    implementing decentralized governance where every token holder in the
    community has a say in the decisions taken in the DAO.


    A number of projects have been executed by the community to foster growth
    and build relationships in the DAO. Some of the projects include:


    * [Bankless Consulting](https://www.banklessconsulting.com/): A service that
    connects over 15,000 web3 talents to professional services in various work
    areas such as tech, marketing, finance, legal, and management.


    * [Degen
    Project](https://bankless.notion.site/DEGEN-f5e1c8e3e9b546ce83025a8359f98da8):
    A discord bot that carries out administrative functions across Bankless DAO.


    * [Podcast
    Hatchery](https://bankless.notion.site/Podcast-Hatchery-0c2676175267445180c8f5cb3d3f14bb):
    A podcast that empowers creators to start their own podcast, improve their
    production skills, and grow an audio-based audience as they share knowledge
    on web3 thereby living out the vision of Bankless DAO.


    * [Bankless
    Loans](https://bankless.notion.site/Bankless-Loans-c6b90fad24b24312b184840e49694f7f):
    This is a DeFi application that provides loans as a way for the DAO to
    generate revenue for its treasury.


    * [Bankless Academy](https://app.banklessacademy.com/): This is an
    application that teaches people with little or no knowledge of crypto to
    become competent crypto users.


    There are more projects in Bankless DAO and they all contribute to achieving
    the mission of onboarding 1 Billion people to the web3 space.


    Finally, Bankless DAO has a governance token (BANK) which it uses to vote on
    decisions made in the DAO. Holders of the token are community members and
    they collaborate to see that Bankless continues to grow and is positioned to
    be a massive success.
