    [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) is a tool for managing salaries,
    grants, and general compensation in DAOs. It allows members of DAOs to
    compensate one another for work done within an epoch. An epoch is considered
    the period of time it takes for contributors to work, and allocate rewards
    to others based on the perceived value of the work done by a contributor. As
    more and more people move towards building permissionless and decentralized
    organizations, the processes for rewarding contributors will be determined
    by the community members who govern the DAO. So, instead of a set of leaders
    or management teams deciding who should get rewarded, Coordinape has made it
    possible for the community to be the driver of growth and rewards. 


    When contributors reward other contributors, they do so by gifting them GIVE
    tokens. GIVE is the native allocation token that has been developed by
    Coordinape to aid the gifting process. How it works is that contributors are
    gifted GIVE tokens and at the end of the reward cycle, the value of the GIVE
    token is converted (as a percentage of the total GIVE tokens in supply) to
    the value of the DAO token or a stablecoin so contributors can get rewarded
    in those tokens defined by the DAO and NOT in GIVE since GIVE does not have
    any real value. This video below explains how anyone can get started with
    Coordinape.

    **Circles**


    The structure that has been put in place by Coodinape to ensure that this
    community-based rewarding system is made possible is known as Circles. A
    circle is a team of people who are allowed to reward one another at the end
    of an epoch. When DAOs want contributors to be able to reward and get
    rewarded, they can set up circles to manage the process. Different DAOs set
    up different types of circles that are unique to their functions. For
    example, a DAO may set up a circle for contributors who work in the same
    work function such as marketing, developers, or operations. This way members
    of these units have a context of the type of work they do and most likely
    what other contributors have done.


    The DAO can also have a core circle for the core team to enable the DAO to
    reward hard-working contributors or generally gift contributors based on
    their discretion. There are other times that the DAO may have a special
    project to work on and in this case, the DAO can as well set up a circle to
    allow the people involved in the project to allocate rewards to one another.
    These are not rules that DAOs must follow but a guide to working with
    Coordinape in the DAO.


    **How to create Circles?**


    Circles can be created by simply clicking on this
    [link](https://app.coordinape.com/new-circle). Once the page loads, you’ll
    be prompted to connect your wallet via MetaMask, Coinbase, Wallet Connect,
    or directly via Ethereum Mainnet. 


    ![connect
    wallet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/rewarding-contributors-in-dao/main/images/tools/Coordinape_Connect%20Wallet.jpg
    "connect wallet")


    Click on the start a circle button after you have connected your wallet and
    set up the rules of the circle. This includes the name of the circle, the
    number of people in the circle, how tokens can be shared among circle
    members, and so on.

    **Contributors on Coordinape**


    Any person who joins Coordinape as a contributor of any DAO, the first thing
    the person has to do is set up their profile. This way they can be invited
    to join circles, or even opt in and out of circles when it’s time to receive
    rewards. To set up your profile. Follow the steps highlighted below:


    1. Visit [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) and connect your wallet

    2. Fill in your name (It is advisable to use the same name that you have on
    Discord so members can recognize one another).

    "Set up profile")


    3. Fill your skills in the field provided and also write a biography about
    yourself.

    4. You can also connect your social media accounts to your Coordinape
    account and change your profile image.

    5. Click on save at the end of the process to complete it. 


    You can also add your contribution at the end of every epoch so other team
    members will have a view of what you worked on within that period. After
    which you will decide whether or not you want to be eligible to receive
    rewards for that epoch by either opting in or opting out of the rewards
    process.

    "add contribution")


    Contributors can also add multiple contributions before or during an epoch
    on the overview page or on the contribution page. Contributors can as well
    allocate GIVE tokens after the epoch to contributors who added value to the
    DAO/Circle. You are encouraged to participate in this process as it gives
    you the power to be a part of the decentralized payroll system. Finally,
    contributors get to receive rewards when GIVE tokens are allocated to them
    by other team members.

    "Allocate GIVE")


    Coordinape has also created a way for contributors to claim their
    allocations on Coordinape if their circle uses the CoVault function. In this
    case, the admin of the DAO can distribute ETH based on the amount of GIVE
    tokens received to members of the circle. This is only available on Mainnet
    for now. Other L1 and L2 chains are on the roadmap.
